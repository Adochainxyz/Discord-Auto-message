Today as i was leaving for work in the morning i had a tire burst in the middle of a busy road. That scared the hell out of me!
Are you fine now?
Yeahi'm doing alright now_comma_ but with minor injuries.
Cool :) Is your car damaged a lot?
The car was badly damaged_comma_i veered outside the road and hit a tree trunk. next thing is insurance follow up.
A few weeks ago_comma_ I was walking through my hallway_comma_ minding my own business_comma_ when all of a sudden a hand reached out from under a table. 
That's funny_comma_ hope he didn't give you a heart attack.
I may have let out a scream that will have him question my manhood for the rest of our lives_comma_ lol.
I would probably scream also.
I'm overly excited because will be flying outside the country for the first time tomorrow.".  Please enter here...
Wow! That sounds amazing. Where are you going?
Traveling to South Africa then to Ghana. Also my first time visiting Africa
You are going to love it I am sure. Safe Travels!
One time_comma_ I was holding my son over my head_comma_ when all of a sudden_comma_ he threw up all over my face. I almost cried.
Thats horrible_comma_ hope he is ok.
yeah_comma_ he had just drank a bottle_comma_ and I was moving him around like an airplane. In retrospect. I deserved it.
I see_comma_ glad he is ok.
Hello
Hi_comma_ how are you?
Im doing great i just wanted to tell you a short story about a time i helped an elderly lady.  She was struggling to carry her bags from a trip she had took.  I helped her carry them to her door ! Pretty good feeling when you help others
That was kind of you_comma_ I am sure they appreciated that!
I went to the Kemah boardwalk with my boyfriend. It made me think of times I went vacationing with my family.
My last vacation went horribly wrongQ!
All I thought about was being at home again and being able to relive those moments.
Yes I love to reminice
My dog died a few years ago after I had my son.  It was right around Christmas and I had the dog for fourteen years.
Im sorry to hear that. I have never had a dog. What was your experience of the dog?
The dog was there with my throughout my life. He saw me through boyfriends and friends.
I am really sorry to hear that. What was the dogs name?
hello
Hello How are you and what is your story chat about today?
I locked my keys in my car about a week ago. It was 95 degrees outside and I was at the store getting groceries.
OMG wow.... i hope you got it open quick!
luckily there are police who patrol around the mall on the other end of the parking lot. one of them got it open for me
Hello
Hi_comma_ a few months ago_comma_ my mother found some stray dogs that were starving_comma_ so she told us about them. Of course_comma_ we brought the poor babies to our house_comma_ a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them_comma_ as their ribs were showing_comma_ but they were still so loving and sweet.
Oh no im so sorry to hear that :/ Thats good that you took them in
Yes_comma_ I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets_comma_ so I wasn't going to keep them_comma_ but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them_comma_ with the puppies being able to stay together.
I wanted to let you know recently i saw a younger man helping an old lady who fell to the ground. Its nice to see people helping others
That is really nice to see... I bet it made you feel good! So sweet.
yeah it made me feel great :)
Nice to still see that behavior in todays world. :)
So this one time my grandmother gave me a scooter_comma_ it was the best gift ever_comma_ I was really happy
Thats sweet that you remember that_comma_ how old were you?
I was around 10 years old I think_comma_ it was quite a long time ago for me now haha!
I wont make you reveal your age! lol :p
Hah appreciated_comma_ have you ever received a fun gift?
I was extremely lucky when my girlfriend said she would date me_comma_ she is my world now.
That's wonderful. How long have you guys been dating?
We have been together for close to 5 months now_comma_ so not very long haha!
Time flies by pretty fast. Could be together 10 years from now!
I hope so haha_comma_ are you dating anyone?
I started a new job about a month ago and it's going really well.
congratualtions. what do you do?
I work in I.T. for the provincial government in Canada :)
oh wow. we're practically neighbors.
So my friend built a deck and it turned out amazing I didn't know he had it in him.
How big was the deck?
I think its probably about 20 feet by 25 feet? I'm bad at guessing that kind of stuff hah
Wow that is big.
My girlfriends really quiet and she tends to scare me a lot.
What is scary about what she is doing? I'm not quite understanding what you mean.
Well_comma_ when shes dealing with her own personal issues she tends to kind of just vanish_comma_ I haven't talked to her in a few days and it's making me worry.
Oh wow  I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon.
I have to fill out forms all day so I scripted a program that does half of it for me and it works really well!
Thats great. Did you create the script?
Yeah had to google a bit of it but it worked out well.
I love google. It is my favorite search engine.
I was extremely relieved when I found out my dad beat cancer.
Thats wonderful news! Its such a nasty disease! How long has he been clear?
About 2 years now.
Well I hope he has 100 more years to go! :)
My girlfriend hasn't talked to me in a few days and I'm struggling to keep it together but I am at the moment.
Have you tried to call her?
I have_comma_ but she's going through a rough time and likes to seclude herself.
Maybe give her space.
My grandma gave me a stone and said it was my birthstone and I hold it very close to my heart now.
What birthstone is it.
It is amethyst.
What birthstone is it?
I play some competitive video games and I think I'm pretty good at one of them.
I love to play Madden.
Do you play Madden often?
Yes_comma_ every day.
I haven't been able to talk to my girlfriend in a few days and it's making me quite sad.
Where is she?
She's in the same city as me_comma_ but she's going through a hard time and has decided to seclude herself so I can't reach her.
Just give her space.
My daughter is very smart. She learns things really quickly.
Thats great.
Yes_comma_ she picks up on things that I didn't even think she knew about.
Did you teach her?
I can't believe how big the waves are. Hurricane Chris amped up my summer.
Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!
Yes_comma_ I've been surfing for ever. Only three of us in the water.
That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat.
You are never to old to start. I'm teaching my mate and he is 70 I think. Hopefully I have a boat soon.'
Wow I hope I am fit enough at 70 to surf!
I usually hate to ask for help_comma_ so when my friends all surprised me by taking turns bringing us meals for 2 weeks after my 4th child was born I was blown away. I was so relieved to have help.
Wow_comma_ 4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.
That is so exciting_comma_ congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family_comma_ so having a great group of friends is really important to us.
Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours?
Get involved in something. Church_comma_ a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups_comma_ for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!
I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult.
I went to this thing called a Paint Night and I ended up making an okay looking painting
That sounds fun_comma_ I was never any good at painting
I am not either_comma_ but they had an instructor to follow along to! :)
That probably helps a good deal!
That Jerk_comma_ Did'nt even wave when he cut me off.
I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!
After the Apocalypse I'll just ran them off the road. To make things worse he was in a Horse and Buggy.
That is terrible_comma_ he could have hurt the horse!
That's what me the most mad. It's like he did not care at all.
So I got a new job recently_comma_ and I got my first paycheck and it was pretty good compared to what I was expecting!
Nice_comma_ congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?
It's pretty good so far_comma_ I think I'm gonna like it for the long haul!
Awesome_comma_ I hope the job goes great for you!
When I was a little girl_comma_ our cat ran away and was gone so long we didn't think he would come home so we adopted another kitten.
Thats sad_comma_ hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you
Well_comma_ we had a funny twist. The same day we brought the new kitten home_comma_ or old cat showed up. We kind of thought maybe he was hanging out close to home and was mad that we replaced him.
Haha thats crazy_comma_ I hope they became best friends_comma_ I love cats.
I really liked having my mom here. She helped with the kids but then when she left I missed it.
I can imagine! That extra set of hands -- and a person you can *trust* -- that's the best!
Yes_comma_ the kids really missed her when she left. It took us a while to get back to the normal around here.
Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.
This one time I spent an entire hour waiting for food at dennys.
An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.
Its really not_comma_ the foods not worth that long of a wait.
I haven't been there in so long for that exact reason.
I went to a nice work dinner with my husband. I can't get over how stupid I made myself look.
Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?
I went to the bathroom real fast before we went into the dining room. I tucked my dress into my panty hose and didn't even notice. I walked past everyone with my underwear showing. I'm sure I'll laugh about it... someday.
Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.
A lady was having issues with a program on her computer_comma_ and I solved it with no problems!
That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!
That sounds unpleasant_comma_ did you get in afterwards?
Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So_comma_ how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?
I'm so angry they end up charging me 255 in charges that did not belong to me.
Yeah_comma_ that is pretty annoying to have happen.
I called them and did not hold back.
Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.
I was going to go down and go nuts but my wife stopped me.
My friend was telling me about teaching jobs to apply for. I didn't get hired_comma_ but she got one right off the bat!
It sounds like you're happy for her_comma_ which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?
I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was.
That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at_comma_ or still looking?
My girlfriend has some mental health issues and sometimes ends up in the hospital_comma_ and I go and see her as often as I can.
I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.
Thanks_comma_ I am definitely trying to be as supportive as I can_comma_ she's my world.
She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!
I love going to places that I explored and play at as a child. Every time I go_comma_ I always feel super nostalgic.
I am very nostalgic too_comma_ that must be a fun time!
Yes_comma_ until you realize that it was 20 years since you played there_comma_ and you start feeling old
That is true_comma_ but it is part of life_comma_ but it is cool to see things again_comma_ regain perspective
I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible boyfriend_comma_ but when my girlfriend first moved into my house_comma_ I felt very apprehensive towards the move at first. I was used to it being one way_comma_ and she was changing everything. Took some getting used to.
I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits.
I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath_comma_ and realize its just things_comma_ and it was just me being reluctant to change.
Yes_comma_ sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!
I always hate thinking that my son is getting old. Just like a few days ago_comma_ I was looking at some of my sons old clothes_comma_ and it made me very sentimental. I never want him to get old on me.
I believe you are really sad although it's a fact of life
Yes. You get to see them change and grow. It makes it all worth it.
True_comma_ and the good thing is that when the kids grow_comma_ they provide moral support to parents.
I love a good surprise like anyone else; however_comma_ when my girlfriend waited until 8 pm on my birthday to tell me happy birthday and give me a present_comma_ I was caught off guard. I thought she had forgot.
Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!
She remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot. I should have known because I made her wait until 10 pm on her birthday.
Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!
I work two full time jobs and he stays at home all day_comma_ Not Fair!
Is he a stay at home father_comma_ or does he just not want to work?
He's 20 he just wants to party and sleep.
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.
Doubtful_comma_ he's a punk!
So the other day was my 23rd Birthday! I had no idea what my friends had planned but i walked into a room_comma_ a room which i thought was empty as the lights were all off_comma_ and all my friends jumped out and yelled happy birthday! It was such a shock_comma_ and felt so nice to have people who cared deeply about me provide me with such an experience!
Must of been pretty surprised_comma_ Also great to have friends like that.
It really was! They even had my favorite kind of cake_comma_ chocolate mousse from my favorite bakery!
That must of just made everything even better!
Right?! I mean who doesn't love cake. But that's not even the best part. on the counter_comma_ there was a HUGE pile of presents calling my name.
I'm thrilled. I got a raise!
That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.
Best Ever. I didn't have a clue I was going to get it. I just walked in and boom got a raise.
You are very lucky
Your not kidding and to think I was going to quit.
Have you seen the film "within" on netflix? The other night my boyfriend and i watched it and I had trouble sleeping afterwards_comma_ it was pretty creepy!
No I haven't actually_comma_ I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though.
Why did you cancel your subscription? If you ever re-subscribe i would definetly recommend checking out "within"!
I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time_comma_ but if I do I will definitely check it out!
I spilt wed wine on my moms red carpet and blamed it on the cat
Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?
Very! It was a dark maroon stain.
Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.
My wife is angry and I don't know what to say. My anniversary was yesterday and I had no clue!
Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations_comma_ which of course only makes it worse!
I'm still working on it. she has has not given me much of a chance.
What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know_comma_ like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead_comma_ playing "your" song?
I used diamond earrings.
So the other night my boyfriend and I were out socializing at a networking event and another woman went up to him and touched his arm I coudn't help but feel a little envious even though he pulled away.
You should not be so insecure like that.
Its not about insecurity!
What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?
Have you ever been to Las Vegas?
yes_comma_ several times.The place is magical.
I'm actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! I'm really excited!
Well_comma_ you are about to have the fun of your life_comma_ but gamble responsible.
I was thinking about my boyfriends wedding proposal the other night_comma_ it had left me in absolute shock. I did not expect him to get down on one knee and propose.
Why. Did you started dating recently or something
No we'd been dating a very long time but he was never the traditional kind. Never wanted an official ceremony but after meeting me i guess it all changed!
The most important thing is what you want.
I'm one of the best surfers that has ever hit the beach. I ride giants.
Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?
Yes_comma_ you can google me.
Are you still competing on a professional level?
Nope_comma_ I've got a family now to support so I surf less and work more. But I've still got killer moves.
I can't believe the bottom of the bag ripped and my wonderful taco's covered the ground. I'm sure my face was bright red with anger.
NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously_comma_ I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!
It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad.
Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead?
A bowl of dry cereal.
Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!
Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.
I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of cry-laughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!
Have you ever participated in any races_comma_ half or full marathons?
I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?
I have not either! My best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon_comma_ it was inspirational!
That's great for her.
I am not afraid to admit this: I am 32 and afraid of the dark. The other day_comma_ my electricity went out due to a storm. It was dark_comma_ I couldn't find my phone or a light_comma_ so I screamed for my girlfriend to wake up. Am I embarrassed to say that_comma_ not at all_comma_ lol
hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?
I am not scared of the dark. I am just scared of the things in the dark. And the ironic thing is_comma_ I don't even believe in the supernatural_comma_ so I am scared of the dark to just be scared of it_comma_ I think.
OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?
Nope. I am just scared that in case there is the supernatural. It makes sense in my head;however_comma_ when I am saying it out loud_comma_ it doesnt_comma_ lol
Before I applied at Inline I really did some background research on the company and what all they were involved in.
That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?
I was!  It ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the CEO and interviewer were really impressed..
Sometimes it's the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!
Thank you!  I really enjoy this position a lot so I am happy it turned out well.
My husband hangs steel and the last time he had to go work in another state I felt really lost and alone for a bit.
I feel the same way when I'm away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?
Sometimes he does.  Lately there hasn't been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back.
Maybe one day if you have the time_comma_ you can pay him a surprise visit.
That is a good idea! I'll have to sneak his work schedule and give it a try.
I made it on time to the bus stop.
That is good. Where you running late
I was running late and so did the bus.
That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind
So I kind of ate the last piece of pizza that we had and I didn't know Tom wanted it... Feeling kinda bad.
I don't think you should feel bad_comma_ you didn't know!
Yeah but he just seemed so disappointed when he came home for lunch.
I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.
I should probably just buy him another pizza soon.
Sounds like a good idea.
I will start off saying I hate the water! I can't stand being in it; however_comma_ that changed last week when I took my son to his first pool. His joy erased all my hatred for water.
Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do!
Yes! I start swimming lessons next week. I have went 32 years without knowing how to swim_comma_ and that one visit changed all that.
That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.
Oh today I heard one of Nannie's favorite songs on the radio.  It made me really miss our car rides together.
Oh that's so sweet. My grandmother is a great person too and I'm glad to know her.
She was a lovely lady indeed!  I miss our time together a lot especially when I hear the music she used to listen to.
I think it's great that you have such positive memories of her_comma_ that way she'll always be there in some form.
Do you go visit some place that makes you miss growing up?
Yes_comma_ I love to visit the zoo!
I recently went back to Michigan and got visit my old town and even the High school I had such great times back then.
What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?
I played Football all 4 years_comma_ used to Skateboard in the parking lot and hang out in the auto shop. The good old days.
My mother was always there for me when I was sick_comma_ annoyed and sad
That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.
Well my dad too but my mum was so much more_comma_ even when I was naughty she was still there.
My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.
When I was little I got chased by a large dog and now that I'm much older the feeling is still the same.
That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?
I am_comma_ everytime I see a dog_comma_ I begin to run the other direction instantly
You need to fight your fear
I actually have no friends_comma_ can you believe that? I'm ok with it though.
wow that's very sad!  I am really sorry!
No_comma_ it's not sad. I really like to be alone_comma_ as i'm an introvert. I need my space.
Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I can't say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family
Well in that case_comma_ I have a few friends. Outside of family_comma_ I don't.
Do you ever find it hard to see at night when it's raining?
Yes I do actually_comma_ I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once.
That's so scary! I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time.
I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened.
Thank you. I've never been in a traffic accident. Thank goodness for that.
I was eating at a restaurant and as I was leaving_comma_ an employee there gave me my phone which I had left behind
Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!
I was_comma_ it saved me a lot of problems
I bet_comma_ losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!
I written down my notes on a double sided A4 paper_comma_ now I just have to wait for the exam which will begin in the next 5 minutes.
Okay that's good to know. Hopefully you pass the test and I hope you studied.
Oh I did_comma_ I have been doing it for weeks!
Very nice man. Let me know your exam results when they're released!
An employee who had not been working as long as me received a promotion
Oh no! I'll bet that made you feel terrible!
I definitely did not feel appreciated
I can see why not! I'm so sorry that happened to you.
When that happened to me_comma_ even the teacher couldn't stop herself from laughing.
That is hilarious. I bet.
I was so awkward and quiet in school_comma_ how about yourself?
Oh my just the opposite LOL
So you were outgoing and popular_comma_ huh?
I can't wait to December when my first born arrives into the world. I'm going to make sure they have a great life.
Oh wow! Congratulations! That is wonderful.
Thanks I'm stressed_comma_ excited and hopeful for the future. Do you have kids?
I do not yet but hope to one day. I think you will be a great parent!
Thank you. We have been trying for a year.
I was just speaking with my buddy. He is very over wight and somehow finished a marathon last weekend. Impressive!
wow yes it is
I couldn't believe it. Just the day before we were crushing cheese steaks.
He probably stored that up for his energy for the race
I guess_comma_ I;m sure he eat again after that. He loves food. If he can do it I know I can run one.
My friend stayed awake for 36 hours studying for the MCAT!
Haha oh wow_comma_ how was that for them
she did well actually_comma_ i was impressed with how well she managed to do despite lack of sleep!
Thats great_comma_ im glad she did well
I was commuting to work and a driver cut me off
I hate it when that happens! were you ok?
I made it out ok_comma_ just so irritating
I always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens.
I was busy due to work and visited my family for the first time in awhile
That sounds nice! DId you have fun
It was great_comma_ felt refreshing to be around them
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself_comma_ it is important to make time for family.
I get so annoyed with people who say one thing and do something else. My boss is one of those people. I wish there was just instance that I could be like this is where he annoyed me_comma_ but that isn't the case. It happens every day.
I'm sorry to hear you're having to deal with that
Yeah_comma_ it can get annoying at times. I just stir clear of him when he is around.
Sounds like the best thing to do honestly
I have an 8 hour shift in the office today but i can't wait to go home to see my boyfriend!
you will survive_comma_ and you have something to look forward to
exactly_comma_ it's keeping me going since i'm not feeling to good today!
i hope your work day goes by fast
When I was 12_comma_ I got ran over by a truck. I was with my older cousin and his car messed up. Since he was my hero_comma_ I listened to everything he said_comma_ so when he told me to get the truck rolling and jump in. I listened. however_comma_ my 12 year old legs didn't make it and got trapped under the truck
Oh wow that is so scary.  I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.
Well_comma_ he was 17 at the time_comma_ so in his defense_comma_ he just was being a "dumb teenager". My parents never let me go with him again after that though.
I really hope you didn't have any lasting effects from the injury?
I only got a B- on an assignment i worked really hard on recently_comma_ but i'm working even harder now studying to ace the exam!
Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?
I do actually!
Congratulations! Studying can be hard_comma_ but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?
I was inspecting rooms yesterday when I bent down to look under a bed_comma_ I felt the back of my pants tear. The hole was the entire back of my pants.
Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!
Yes_comma_ I have a staff of 30 and I think each one saw me at some point in the day. I have Khaki's on. I had to tape and staple the hole.
Ugh! That's the worst! Too bad you couldn't run home and change!
That would have been nice. But home is an hour each way.
I had to compose myself and pull over to remove the spider. I'm so thankful that I didn't freak out and crash the car.
Oh that sounds so scary!
It was very scary_comma_ i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of?
I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.
So as I've gotten older over the last 10 years. I gained 30 pounds. My wife has me on a diet but every night when she goes to bed I have a bowl of ice cream.
Don't even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted
yea but those times are behind us. Tonight for dinner was a Kale salad. It was gross but I've gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later. I do feel bad for lying to her but I need it.
Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.
I think I'm average. I'm 5'11" 190. It could be worse. I still exercise a lot. Perhaps I need to enjoy the ice cream more and try to feel less guilty.
Did you ever attend college? I just completed my bachelor's degree and I'm feeling really good about my future!
Yes_comma_ I have an Associate's in Nursing.
Wow that's great you must enjoy helping others!
Yes_comma_ it's been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!
Have you ever felt sandpaper on your bottom? Because that is what the new recycled toilet paper my wife want's us to use feels like.
Holy smokes! Let me guess_comma_ better for the environment?
yes but in the end it's still paper and still going to the same place. I dream of the day I can enjoy Angel Soft or Charmin again.
You poor soul! I'm all for saving the planet_comma_ but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!
I'm going to have to start waiting until I go to work to use the potty.
I scored a 95 on my promotion exam_comma_ I was upset that I missed one question.
But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!
Thank you_comma_ I am definitely proud! When was your last exam?
Oh_comma_ it's been years since I've taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a para-pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn't even give me the grade - it was a pass/fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!)
On the way from work I hit 155 in my VW on the Autobahn. I was well impressed with the car.
I love the Autobahn.
I've been faster in my old Audi but this little car is a 4 cylinder and still super fast.
Yes I use to own an Audio.
Awesome_comma_ it's time to buy another.
Last weekend I did something big. I finished my first 125 mile Iron man race. I'm still pumped.
I have never done that_comma_ good job.
That's it was a bucket list item and the hardest thing I have ever done but now I want to do it again.
You should. When is the next one.
This fall. I'm need to train more. It was a 26 mile running race_comma_ 10 mile swim and the rest on bikes. So much fun!
Last night I was looking at my things I have in a storage locker and found a tub filled with my grandfathers things. The good memories came flooding back.
Oh wow thats cool.
Yes_comma_ he's been gone 10 years but I still think of him daily. It's strange how someone can make such an impact on someone for so long.
Thats good you still think of him.
Yes_comma_ he was my hero and still is I guess.
I went to a school for massage therapy_comma_ but I was worried at first that it would be strange to massage people I didn't know.
Thats cool. Was it hard?
Some of it was. I had to learn the name_comma_ attachment point_comma_ and action of every muscle in the body. There are over 800.
Wow that is a lot.
I think I get it from my mom. She would never open the door for uninvited guests.
What do you get from your mom?
Being bothered by uninvited guests
I don't like uninvited guests either! So annoying!
Some people think it's ridiculous to have a problem with that_comma_ but I adore my privacy and space.
My first dog was a dalmatian. We adopted her and then went right to a soccer game before I even had time to play with her.
I love dalmatians.
She was a great dog! That game felt so so long though. I had to watch her sitting with my parents while I played.
How old was she.
6 weeks when we got her.
I have a friend who is always complaining. She always has to make it sound like her life is harder than everyone else's.
Well maybe it is but it could also just be she's spoiled.
I didn't know her when she was young_comma_ so she could be. I think she just likes to be miserable.
Does she have like some other issues like mentally?
I wouldn't be surprised.
Have you ever put a pair of shoes on your feet that felt so sweet that made your sole happy?
I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in.
yea_comma_ I had that but recently my shoes wore out and they no longer make them. I'm so sad!
That is the worse_comma_ you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst_comma_ happens to me all the time.
Yes_comma_ I was angry and sad.
So did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had_comma_ or have you been unsuccessful?
nope_comma_ I gave up on shoes all together.
I was on lunch and my coworker made me laugh. I pee'ed my self. I felt like I wanted to die.
Wow_comma_ did they notice?
yep_comma_ to make it worse I'm the boss. I'm pregnant so I tried to pass it off like the baby was pressing on my bladder.
They will forget about it soon.
The next day someone had put a diaper in my desk.
Becasue of a certain person who worked at the corner grocery I became uneasy to shop there.
I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?
They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money.
That's the worst! You think you can trust people_comma_ and then they stab you in the back. I don't blame you for not wanting to see them again.
I just found out my new insurance is going to cover my big dental surgery coming up. No more bad jibbers!
That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?
Yes_comma_ they are covering $4_comma_500 worth of work. I only have to pay $100 total. I can't wait to have good teeth.
That is nice. Good luck with the sugery.
Thanks_comma_ I'm a little scared but it will be worth it. Being from the UK bad teeth are in my genes.
I have a solo trip coming up. I'm going to Colorado to climb Mt. Elbert Solo. It's the tallest mountain in the united states.
I love Colorado_comma_ my favorite state.
Yes me two. I used to live in Colorado. I have not been up a mountain that big in years_comma_ I'm getting the belly butterfly's.
I wish I could live there.
It was a great place to live but very expensive and winter was rough.
Last weekend I was on a date with a wonderful guy but right after dinner I got bad gas.
Did you fart?
It sounded like trumpets were filling the room. He looked like he wanted to puke each and ever time.
Did they smell?
Have you ever drove past a cow farm or garage dump? Yes_comma_ well those smell better then I did that night.
We had a hail storm about a month ago. It ruined our roof so we are trying to find a good roofing company to replace it.
Did anyone get hurt?
No_comma_ thank goodness. Just a lot of car and property damage in the area.
Thats good_comma_ as long as no one got hurt.
My husband just ran a Marathon. He had no training I was blown away by him. True inspiration!
No training at all!  Wow_comma_ that's pretty impressive.  How far is a marathon?
26.2 miles. He walks about 10 miles a day at work so that's some training sorta.
That's still pretty impressive.  I bet he was proud of himself also!  Does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?
He wants to do an Iron Man. 126.2 miles_comma_ running_comma_ biking and swimming.
WOW - he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.
Yes_comma_ I'm well impressed with him.
I don't like saying this_comma_ and this is the first time I have but a few days ago I drove by my ex-wife and mine house_comma_ and for a few seconds it made me nostalgic.
Wow you are brave.
Yes_comma_ it was only a fleeting moment but it was there.
I bet you drove fast.
I'm going skydiving this weekend. I'm afraid of heights and freaking out a little.
Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it_comma_ I don't think.
Yea_comma_ until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either.
Have you ever done anything else so frightening?
Yes_comma_ I love doing something crazy and the feeling I get from it.
I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me_comma_ I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!
That's i'm so scared but it will be worth it. You only have one life so don't hold back.
Can you believe that I learned to ride a bike at age 15?
At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.
Really? I didn't know that. Is there anything that you'd say you were a late bloomer for?
Love_comma_ it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me.
Well congratulations for taking your time_comma_ look at it that way.
yes not if I can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip.
Maybe try controlled breathing exercises_comma_ I'm sure you'll be fine and want to do it again.
Hope so. I don't do well with heights.
I had a huge exam that like 25 percent of my grade. I study for 2 weeks for it
Oh_comma_ I bet that was very stressful and difficult. I hope you did well on it?
Yeah because the professor got mad that the book store didn't have the little blue books to write in_comma_ so he canceled it and said whatever our current grade was to bump it up a letter grade
Well_comma_ at least you didn't go down in your grade. But_comma_ it wasn't right to treat the students like that!
As i get older I've fully accepted who I am. I'm not here to impress. It makes life easier when you think like this.
That is good_comma_ how old are you?
33 so not super old or super young. Just happy with who I am.
I am 31 so same generation.
Have you stopped caring yet? About others opinions?
Got a pizza last night. It gave me food poison. Now I'm stilling here sick and angry.
Oh gosh_comma_ I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know?
Yes_comma_ I called and they laughed at me. Told me it was the new pizza buy and that he must have used old cheese or something.
Wow! In that instance_comma_ I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food.
Yes_comma_ for the first 12 hours I just had to lay in the bathroom floor in pain.
I had studied for an exam for several days_comma_ so I was confident when I strolled into class because I knew I would ace it
and did you knock it out of the park?
Uh_comma_ I made a B on it_comma_  so it was a false sense of confidence_comma_ lol
Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way B's get degree's.
When my son was 5 years old_comma_ he had to have his tonsils taken out. I thought it would be nothing_comma_ but when they went to take him back_comma_ I got so anxious.
Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.
Yeah_comma_ he was fine_comma_ but I had read a few horror stories online. I knew I shouldn't_comma_ but I did.
That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.
My neighbors are still doing fireworks every night around midnight. Scares my dogs and they can't sleep through it.
Oh_comma_ I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?
We don't know them well_comma_ but if they do it again tonight we probably will. I understand on the 4th and even a couple of days after_comma_ but some people have to get up for work.
I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.
My dog had bone cancer and we had to put her down. It was a very sad_comma_ but necessary decision.
it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.
It was very hard_comma_ but she was suffering. Our vet was very helpful and we did ask him if he thought it was too soon. He assured us that it was not.
She had a happy life. I'm sure she understands.
My mom is here visiting me and my family. It has been a really fun visit.
Sounds nice. How long has it been since you've seen her?
About seven months. Too long.
Oh wow. That is a long time. Do you live far apart?
Yes_comma_ about a 17 hour drive.
We had a really great guest speaker at work today.
That's awesome! What did they talk about?
He was a retired FBI agent who talked about his experiences in the field in the 1970's.
Fascinating! What kind of work do you do?
I'm a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects.
Sounds like it was very exciting!
Yeah he talked about his toughest cases and some funny storties about suspects who incriminated themselves with simple linguistic tricks.
I am a bit Breaking Bad fan and love Better Call Saul. Season 4 starts in August.
Me too! I also Iike staying home all day.
I wonder what will happen this season. I'm expecting it to be really nail biting.
I have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot. I stay home with my little one year old during the day.
I came home today and someone had eaten my leftovers. I was so irritated!
I hate when that happens!  I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?
Yes_comma_ it was my partner. He owes me big time
I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!
Right! He says i'm greedy anyway_comma_ but that's besides the point!
I got into some serious financial troubles a few years back.
It happens to everyone_comma_ are you out of it now?
yeah but what I did was terrible. I was self employed and I manipulated the system so I received money I was not owed/. My husband helped me out of the jam once I came clean about aht I did.
Oh well_comma_ it was nice to have someone to help you.
Do you like fair rides? I can't take them myself.
I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily
Yes_comma_ I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta.
Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.
I just don't think they're safe enough_comma_ many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly.
yeah_comma_ and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them
I'll just stick to the food and go home. Funnel Cakes and Polish Sausages are my favs.
Two years ago_comma_ I discovered that my now ex-wife was cheating on me with someone she worked with. When I first discovered it_comma_ i was angry and hurt.
I bet you were_comma_ I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.
I know it was a horrible experience at the time_comma_ now I think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Sleeping in different beds for 3 years isn't healthy. It took that to wake me up
I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.
I wish I could go back to the 80's for a little while at times.
Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
That's nothing but the truth! What's your favorite era?
Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
Do you have a favorite era?
Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life
Did you graduate high school? It's a lot harder than most people think.
Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed
I didn't think I woudl have to do that much studying. I figured that came later in college.
So if not by studying _comma_what else?
I hit my toe on the edge of the doorway and it bent backwards. I was furious and crying at the same time!
That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital?
No_comma_ I don't have insurance. Just like when I twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell. It took months to heal_comma_ but it healed.
You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.
That's hilarious! I can't afford it right now though. I'll just be more careful.
Sometimes we can get a phone call that shakes us to the core.
That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!
My phone call was my mom telling me my 32 year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house.
Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!
I can't believe my husband planned this all by himself! My mind is still blown by this!
Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?
We are going to Mexico. I have mixed feelings_comma_ but mostly excited!
When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?
It's our 10th anniversary. We are making the drive to FL since we live in Georgia.
Don't you hate when you have to give stuff away and then can't? Well_comma_ that happened to me recently. I was going to give away some of my son's old toys_comma_ but started looking at then and realized that I need to keep them for no other reason than that I was being sentimental
That's too funny. You know_comma_ I'm the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!
I know! I am always like I need this notebook that has my 3rd grade handwriting back from the 90s because it will be very useful someday... lol
Yes_comma_ someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling
I was looking through some of my old pictures a week or so ago_comma_ and saw a picture of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago
I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?
Yes_comma_ we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town_comma_ so it allowed me to get really close with her.
That's sweet_comma_ I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!
I was frozen in fear at the gym Monday_comma_ when a guy started seizing. He got so violent and ran away from paramedics.
Wow_comma_ that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?
They couldn't capture him_comma_ he jumped the fence by the pool and rolled down a hill. I don't know what happened to him.
That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing you'll have to deal with again!
I hope not! I'm not good with crisis situations at all!
Yes_comma_ I was surprise on how he changed to another talk
What was the initial talk?
I should descript how I could feel when am lonely
So how do you feel when lonely?
Wow_comma_ the situation is always very bad
It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great_comma_ and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!
Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.
It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great_comma_ and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!
yes_comma_ i understood the first time.
Oh_comma_ sorry_comma_ I meant to say Ex-wife. I am so glad she didn't. The years haven't be kind to her_comma_ so got out just at the right time_comma_ lol
I slipped on a puddle in the mall once. I was so embarrassed that I pretended I was hurt badly.
I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt_comma_
Even animals get embarrassed_comma_ I've seen it in my cats.
Oh really? I haven't seen that in an animal as of yet. That's pretty interesting.
Yes_comma_ my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed.
Oh dang_comma_ talk about a fall! If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol
One day my girlfriend told me about a guy that works with her and she mentioned how hilarious he was which then made me think of a meme that i read about how funny guys will make you laugh and then all of a sudden you don't have clothes on. It was only for a split second but it happened
That is a hilarious intro_comma_ thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things_comma_ you have nothing to worry about ;-))
Well_comma_ I most def want to be insightful and intelligent_comma_ so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about_comma_ but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing "Along Came Polly" sceneros in your head.
These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov_comma_ you crazy kids!
Lately_comma_ my two year old boy has been so much into wearing dresses and playing with babie dolls_comma_i don't even want to think of i
Is that good or bad? Why the concern?
I think it is bad
OK why do you think so?
Boys are meant to be playing with car toys not dolls.
It is such a privilege to be able to help someone in any way you can.
Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem
It also makes me feel bad when i'm unable to help.
I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another_comma_ we would not have much problem
That is so true! There is no reason for there to be a problem with famine in the world.
My math teacher told the class I needed to do better on my next test.
Well you should try to study more and see what happens
I did_comma_ I can't remember_comma_ I either made an A or a B in there.
Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf
Well_comma_ this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever_comma_ but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago_comma_ I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me_comma_ and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks_comma_ in the middle of the road_comma_ jumped out_comma_ and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short_comma_ I saw my own reflection in the mirror.
THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.
It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it_comma_ lol
That's hilarious_comma_ But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?
I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore. Granted_comma_ I am 32 now_comma_ lol
Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared_comma_ especially during storms.
Why no response?
I'm supposed to wait for you to start. :)
Is my response not good enough?
You haven't said anything yet other than asking why I hadn't responded. Sorry I'm a little lost as to what I was supposed to respond to?
Se
It is really hot here most of the year.
Really?  Where do you live at?
Alabama. It's winter for about 2 weeks.
I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando_comma_ Florida.  So Im in the same boat.
Ok I was in Walmart buying a video game when this dud eshows up and immediately questions my selection. Like it's some kind of internet forum!
That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???
I dunno_comma_ but I just said "That's great_comma_ bro" and left.  Then he follows me to the checkout counter to continue giving me crap about it.
I would be scared of a guy like that.
Well I just got incensed with him and told the clerk to do something about him or I'm not shopping there anymore.  He was told to leave.
This was several years back. I was single_comma_ but I also like watching The Notebook type of movie_comma_ so i thought it would be okay to go watch The Vow alone. Wrong! Horrible mistake. It was a tear jerker_comma_ and I had no one there to see it and be like awe. All those tears wasted for nothing! lol
Aww... sorry to hear that. I haven't personally seen the show. What hit you the most?
Oh_comma_ it was a movie about a woman who lost her memory_comma_ and her husband had to get her to fall back in love with him. At the time_comma_ I was like I want that; however_comma_ now that I am in a relationship_comma_ I am like I don't know about this. I wish she would get amnesia as well
Sounds like a touching but sad story. Love without two ways interaction is really hard. I can't imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly..
I was joyful because my grandad shared the gospel with me when I was 11.
You mean nostalgic?
I guess I am nostalgic now.
What your grand father did to you was very special.
He read a tract to me. He explained God's love for me with pictures in a way I could understand.
Can you believe that my neighbors downstairs allow their dog to relieve itself in the street?
That is not very considerate or respectful_comma_ plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street.
That's what i'm afraid of as well! But the dog seems to only want to use it that way. Do you like your neighbors?
I live in the country_comma_ so I do not have neighbors that live close.
How fortunate_comma_ my grandparents lived in the country. I would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories.
I sometimes get freaked out_comma_ but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors.
That's true. You can live in peace.
Yes. Peace is key.
I regret drinking way too much soda. Now my teeth look bad.
Uhmmnn! Cut down on the intake
I quit. Probably going to need some fillings.
You need to see a dentist then
Have you ever felt really annoyed at yourself?
Just all the time.Who does not?
Yeah right now I dont know how to make a game install on another drive. Do you?
It depends on the machine you are working on.
This is a silly story_comma_ but it reminds me how confident teenagers can be. When I got my first tattoo_comma_ for some reason_comma_ it gave me this false sense of confidence. I am not sure why other than at the time I thought my tribal tattoo was something to admire
Do you have a tribal tattoo. How does it look like?
I got it when I was 18. I didn't take care of it_comma_ so now it looks like a shady prison tattoo_comma_ lol
That was bad. You can try some tattoo removal tool
A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink_comma_ but I didnt have any cash_comma_ so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something
Did you know them well? You must be very trusting.
A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink_comma_ but I didnt have any cash_comma_ so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something
I think I would have just said I didn't have any cash and let that be the end of it.
Not really. The individual kind of seemed shady as well_comma_ but my debit card has a feature that allows me to turn it off
I never expected to fail my final exams_comma_that is a major blow for me.
Sorry! Try harder next time!
Yeah_comma_ i know_comma_i ought to have taken my studies seriously.
Never late you know!
Am surprised there is no response from my friend.
That sucks. Are they mad or what?
Sucks? I don't know about sucks.
It's kinda annoying to me when people don't call you back.
I was scared when I was in a wreck.
Serious? Why are you scared when you are in a wreck?
I was on an overpass and didn't want to fall off.
Wow_comma_ you really have to be careful dear.
Have you ever felt really ashamed?
Yes I have_comma_ it feels really bad when it happens.
Yeah same. Sometimes I can make a fool of myself by trying to act too smart or something like that.
Yea it can be quite embarrassing to look back on.
My younger brother always get the best dates and beautiful girls to date_comma_i hate it.
Come on_comma_ you do not have to be jealous of your brother
I can't handle that very well. I need to get my groove and swag on. Damn it!
You can learnt some skills from your brother. Maybe it will help
It's high time i get my self a girlfriend_comma_i feel so bored up
Are you trying to go out and meet some ladies
Yeah_comma_ i'm so ready to date.I want to meet my person.
That is the first step. What you have to do next is be at your best behavior always
I really feel like depressed sometimes when I realize how bad my tech skills are.
Do you work in the tech industry? You could always take a class.
That's true. There's a lot of stuff online. No I'm completing college for a natural sciences degree lol.
There's ton's online_comma_ and knowing more about computers can really help any profession.
I don't like it when people talk with their mouth full of food
I am sure it is something disgusting. Do you have someone do it around you
Yeah_comma_ i close friend of mine likes doing that. she has to stop.
You can just let him know you are not comfortable with it
I saw an article of someone I went to high school with who was working with an Ebola patient?
yes the patient is very ill
It was cool cause her dad died of cancer_comma_ so now she is helping sick people.
oh that is really a bad news i heared
hi
What is it that you would like to share with me? I am very interested to hear about it!
I am excited I bought a lottery ticket today and the jackpot is over 20 million
Whoa_comma_ I hope you win! You never know_comma_ it could be your lucky day!
Yes_comma_ you never know I was talking to a co-worker today and she won $2500 last year at this time
I have never been ready like this for an exam in my entire life.
I know how you feel_comma_ I get so scared when exams come up_comma_ its so hard sometimes
Open book exams can be tricky_comma_ i have no option but to pass this exam.
Yea open book make you think you dont need to study but that isnt true at all
hi there
Hi
i just got my bachelors degree in english with a gap of 3.5
Cool_comma_ I could not do English.
yea it was really tough but i finally did it. 4 years strong lol
I was impressed because my boss has 2000 investment clients. That seems like so much work.
yea that does seem like a lot of work could you ever handle it?
Maybe. Some of them he got from a guy who retired though.
ooo well that explains a lot. well hopefully he will pass some to you
I felt really elated to be getting work done. It's hard sometimes and  I pulled through. The happiness is real too!
Which work are you talking about. it is always a good feeling to get things done. There a way your brain reward you with good feeling
It was just some stuff for a new job. Do you feel happy to complete stuff?
Oh yes_comma_ i do most times. Who does not
I am trying to decide where I should go next on vacation_comma_ I love travelling.
I say think of all the places you always wanted to go and then choose a place you never even considered.
That is interesting but I usually look for deals so I can go to more places
Yes deals will allow you to travel more for sure.
Yes_comma_ they also do take me to places I wouldn't think of going until I see the deal
today i saw the lottery was for 36 million at the gas station so I decided to buy a ticket.
Do you think you can win the lottery

Oh no_comma_ I've had a few days like that. Did you laugh it off?
Not really I was just mortified!! One shoe was plain black and the other had a pink bow on it at the front.  I had to walk about all day while the whole office couldnt stop laughing.  I think by the end of the day though I tried to see the funny side.
Well good on you for toughing it out. Your the stronger for it.

the hardest lesson in life is that we're all alone

Hello friend! May I ask what it that you feel that way about?
It encourage to be impressed.
I don't understand what you are talking about. Are you feeling okay today?
You need to be happy for you to live longer

Yeah for sure_comma_ that's why I always like to be happy
Also your home stays blessed because you become a more better partner
My roommate and I used to plan for weeks to prepare for music festivals!
Wow that must be lot of preparation
It was_comma_ but part of the fun was getting ready!  Sometimes the planning can be just as fun as the event!
Where is this event going to be
I have done all my paper work for my exam tomorrow_comma_ now i can relax until tomorrow.
That's amazing. It's good to give your head a rest so that you will recall all the items easily when you are at the exam center
Thanks_comma_ I think I have learnt everything because redid each past exam paper 10 times.
I wish you all the best in the Exam
I recently got great news_comma_ medically.
Thats good_comma_ I am not sure if I can ask what happened?
I'm glad you did!  I had a tumor removed_comma_ and it was NOT cancerous!
Oh wow_comma_ I am glad that you are okay.
The other night I went outside to unplug the pool pump and saw a snake. We have poisonous snakes around us so I was a bit worried when I saw it.
Omg I would have ran faster than forest gump... what did you do?
I ran inside and got my husband out of bed. He killed it since we have little kids we didn't want to take a risk that it was poisonous.
Im glad no one was hurt!
I was on facebook and my memories popped up reminding me that I lost my dog to bone cancer three years ago.
Oh no_comma_ I'm sure that was a hard memory to have brought up for you.
It was_comma_ she was a very special dog. One of the old souls with a heart of gold. I still miss her.
What was her name? Have you read Rainbow Bridge?
Yes_comma_ It is a beautiful poem! Her name was Skyber.
What a beautiful name! Hopefully your memories are more happy than sad now.
I am so happy I was able to pass my teacher certification test and become an English teacher.
That's great. Teachers are so important.
It's such a fulfilling job. The test was difficult_comma_ but I spent a lot of my free time studying for it.
I wanted to become a teacher before. I was afraid of how hard it would be.
It's a lot of work_comma_ but if you really put in the effort_comma_ it becomes much easier.
Well congratulations! I hope your students appreciate you as much as they should.
I was in a back room in our house and everyone else was asleep. I heard a weird crinkling noise and was worried that someone had come in the house.
Oh my goodness_comma_ did you go to check what the noise was?
I did_comma_ it turned out to be my cat playing with a play mat the kids left out.
I'm glad it wasn't anything serious! It's scary how quick our mind goes to the worst possible scenarios.
When I turned 25 I got my first surprise party thanks to my parents.
That's really cool of them. You weren't expecting it at all_comma_ hu?
No. I just thought we were going to an early dinner together.
Parents can be great sometimes. Did you have a good time?
i found some old keepsakes in my parents basement and it made me feel nostalgic
What did you find?
old toys_comma_ sports equipment_comma_ video games etc
I love old school video games. What were your favorites?
chrono trigger was my favorite
For my current job_comma_ I thought about interview answers that I did poorly on before. I was able to ace this interview and have been there for three years!
Congratulations. Interviews can be stressful
True. The interview I had before I got this job went so_comma_ so badly. I studied some common questions so I was ready the next time.
Thats smart. And it worked.
My puppy is turning 2 years old next month. The day I adopted her was one of the best days of my life.
Nice. What is his name?
Churro. He's a boxer mix.
Nice. I like dogs.
I went zip-lining in Thailand once. A nearby tree fell and part of it hit the platform we were on.
Oh my that sounds so scary! Was everyone ok?
We were all fine. A bit shaken up_comma_ but nobody got hurt thank goodness.
Do you think you will ever zip line again?
Oh yes. It was a great experience.
My son experienced stranger anxiety and didn't want to be out in public.
oh no. What do you do for that?
We had to leave the restaurant before everyone could order drinks.
Oh. How old is he?
He is one and it was sad because I stay at home all day so that was my chance for some interaction.
Today as soon as I got to work I got sick. I have a new coworker that stepped in and helped me out. Her works looks good but I'm nervous.
Well_comma_ I hope you are feeling better. What makes you so nervous? Are you worried your superiors will look down on you leaving early?
No we are allowed to help each other but I'm worried his code will not pass once the program is done.
I'm sure you can get in tomorrow and see how it looks. You can work together to make sure it works!
I work so. I want to trust him but we have only worked together a few weeks.
I just upgraded the turbo on my car. I wanted more power but currently my VW can beat a corvette in a race. So I'm happy
That is very cool! How much did it cost?
I did all the work my self but the parts were around 4500 besides the price off the all work I've all ready done to it. I'm trying to build a grocery getter that I can take to the race track.
Wow_comma_ sounds nice! Was it hard to do the work?
Not really I enjoy working on cars. I work a white collar job so I went off work I like to do something different.
Hired 4 more people to join my crew at work last week. 2 all ready quit. I'm bummed.
Dang_comma_ that really stinks. Why did they quit so quickly?
The  work was to physically hard for them. But I still had big hopes for them.
Perhaps you should screen new employees better? Like give them a physical performance test?
I wish. It's hard to find anyone that is willing to work hard.
We are supposed to do the amusement park_comma_ tomorrow but I think it may rain.
I hope it's nice for you. Do you have any alternate plans?
We do_comma_ but I think my friends want to do the amusement park as well as something else. I don't know if I have money for both.
Well_comma_ that's always a problem for me too_comma_ but at least you've got another $1.25 now.
Hello! I recently read an article about medical marijuana now being allowed in the united kingdom_comma_ What do you think about it?
I think that is wonderful_comma_ it's about time more countries and states are making this medicine an option.
the way it ended up being legalized_comma_ IMO_comma_ was a complete disgrace_comma_ they confiscated some childs weed who was epileptic_comma_ and as a result - predictably - he immediately started having seizured without it. Like gee_comma_ well done on torturing the kid! Do you think it was right to confiscate it_comma_ even though it technically wasnt legal at the time?
No_comma_ but as Mark Twain once said_comma_ the law is an ass.
what an excellent quote
I'm glad they made the right decision eventually though. It's about time!
The coolest race I saw was a high school 3200 meter relay.
The coolest race I saw was late at night on the highway out of town.
I am a bad driver_comma_ otherwise I might like it.
Yeah_comma_ it can be pretty dangerous_comma_ but I was young.
Sometimes I race after the stop light_comma_ but that's it.
My hamster Donatello just died.
I'm sorry to hear that. How long did you have him?
I had him for two years. He was my best friend.
I bet pets are amazing. They're hard to replace once they're a part of the family
Exactly_comma_ I just don't know how I'm going to get over it. I don't want another hamster I want Donatello back.
I cant believe my brother snitched on me. He told my girlfriend I cheated on her.
Oooh_comma_ that's rough. Did you make him mad?
No_comma_ he just doesn't understand the meaning of loyalty.
Well_comma_ I hope you can work things out at least
I didnt like flying abroad
Flying has seemingly become terrible these days. What about your trip was so bad?
It was snowingh really bad and the plane had to land in SC instead of Chicago
That sounds frustrating and a little scary.  Did you eventually make it to your destination?
No_comma_ I decided to cancel and eventually went home next day.It was the best idea.
That's too bad.  But better safe than sorry.
Yea that was the idea. Go back to safety zone. No place like home. Have you traveled much ?
Not too much.  I used to fly a lot but not anymore.  I stick around home now mostly.
I miss beating my brother in the Pokemon card game everyday.
Well_comma_ have you tried reliving that through the Pokemon app that you can interact with?
No_comma_ I need the real thing it just doesn't feel the same.
Yes_comma_ I can understand that.. Sometimes nothing compares.. Have you guys played recently?
My boyfriend had to go out of town for a few days and I was left alone in the apartment. I didn't have many friends here at the time.
I know how that feels. I bet it was boring and lonely.
Yeah_comma_ it was. I didn't have much to do all that weekend and the apartment was quiet.
Did you get out and do anything?
My son starts kindergarten next month. I don't know what I will do since I don't work.
That really is a big change for you! Are you excited to have some more down time?
I am but also not sure how I feel like him "leaving the nest".
Yeah_comma_ that feeling will change when you see him coming home with a huge smile on his face!
I hope so!
I was flying to Alaska and it was a nervewracking flight.
Was it a long flight? Or was there lots of turbulance?
It was about 9 hours. A little bit of turbulance. I just have nothing to do on flights.
Ah_comma_ I can't imagine being up in the air that long! Sounds like it was a boring flight too.
Well the sights outside were pretty
I guess that is one positive!
I studied all night and I still flunked my math test. I can't believe it!
Did you study hard?
Yes_comma_ it just baffles me. Maybe next time I shouldn't even study.
No_comma_ you should keep studying.
I really wanted a certain job and I did not get it
That stinks_comma_ it's never worth giving up though! What line of work do you prefer?
Video work. It is very competitive.
I can definitely believe that.. I hope something opens up for you soon!
It was so fun!
What was so fun?
Taking my dog to the dog park!
Oh yeah!!! I love taking my dog too_comma_ she gets to get all that dang energy out before I bring her back to our little apartment!
Yeah_comma_ my golden retriever is really happy to meet people. For some reason he doesn't care much for other dogs.
I really miss my dog who passed away.
That sucks_comma_ I love dogs.
Me too. She is a better place now.
Yes I am sure she it.
The other day I lost control of my car and got in a huge wreck. My leg broke_comma_ but I knew I would walk again.
Wow.. That is horrific!  I'm so glad you're okay.. Was anyone else hurt?
No_comma_ by the grace of god. He protects me at all times.
Awesome. I am so glad to hear that.. Always good to hear the stories were someone gets away!!
I hate when I make plans and the rain cancels them....
I agree with that! I just had the rain cancel my trip to the beach yesterday! Makes me so mad...
Yeah_comma_ some people like the rain! I don't get how.....
I mean I like the rain at certain times.. But not when I'm trying to do fun stuff outside!
At least it's the summer so being in the rain doesn't make you freezing cold! If you're in the northern hemisphere that is.
I'm planning to return to college for engineering which should be cool.
That is such a brilliant idea_comma_ are you excited about it?
Yeah_comma_ I have more years left.
That's awesome_comma_ you'll thank yourself later down the road for making yourself do it!
I hope to get a cool job_comma_ not sure what industry I want to be in_comma_ maybe cars or airplanes.
I caught somebody stealing a package from my front yard on surveillance.
Oh wow! I have heard of that happening to lots of people. Did they get arrested?
Not yet. People these days just don't care. They steal anything they lay their eyes on!
Yes they do. It has gotten really bad around here with car thefts. It's no wonder are car insurance rates are so high.
I just got back from buying a few groceries at the store.
Oh really? What'd ya get?
Just stuff for dinner. At the checkout_comma_ a guy took my receipt!
Why did he do that?
I am not sure. He was on his phone though.
I studied really hard for my math test last week_comma_ so I knew I would ace it.
Math is a tough subject. Good for you.
I know_comma_ I feel like I can solve math problems that even Einstein couldn't solve.
Being good at math will open lots of opportunities for you. Keep at it.
We have taken many unplanned trips this summer that I didn't have money for. But I was able to pick up more work and pay for them.
How exciting that you were able to do that. I hope it was fun.
It has been a fun summer! I am so tired though.
It's funny how you need a vacation to recover from vacation.
Oh yes! I have so many pictures to go through though!
I had a major project and felt very ready to present it to everyone at the office
How'd it go
It went well_comma_ I think I gained confidence by being so prepared
That's great. Do you present often?
I was walking home late at night and noticed I was being followed
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
I ended up running back to my place
Glad you are safe!
My girlfriend seems to be distant and talking to other guys
Have you talked to her about it?
Not yet_comma_ she's also been texting other guys as well I think
That doesn't sound too good. Has she been like this before?
I finished a team based project with some co-workers
Was it fun? Interesting? Engaging?
Yeah_comma_ it was fun_comma_ and we did so well
Good! Team based projects can be very hit or miss depending on your team so I'm glad it worked out for you
My girlfriend broke up with me
Did she give you a reason?
She fell out of love with me
Sorry to hear that_comma_ i hope you find somebody else in your life.
I left my wallet behind by accident
Sorry to hear that.Did you lose money?
I left in the bathroom and was able to get it back
So_comma_ you never actually lost the wallet.
A friend threw a birthday party for me
That sounds amazing! How did it go?
It was a lot of fun_comma_ I had no idea he was planning it
That's amazing_comma_ I have only had one brithday party like that in my life.
I found some old toys of mine
What kind?
Some action figures I had when I was younger_comma_ I felt pretty nostalgic
I use to have a G.I Joe.
A friend of mine was sick
What were they sick from?
Flu_comma_ I went over and gave him some food and medicine
That was nice of you.
A friend who I hadn't seen in awhile showed up at my door
I'll bet you were surprised. Were you glad to see them?
I was very happy to see him_comma_ we ended up going out for drinks
Did you reconnect and promise to keep in touch?
I met a girl I hadn't seen in some tme
Was she your girlfriend?
No_comma_ but we did end up going out on a date
That is great_comma_ did you have fun?
I really hated it when my dog got into the trash. It spilled everywhere.
Yeah_comma_ thats rough. I hate having to clean up mess that wasn't my fault.
Yeah_comma_ it was pretty gross. A lot of rotten food.
Yeah_comma_ that sounds annoying. Maybe try to scold the dog so they won't do it again?
I did. He is just a puppy_comma_ so hopefully he will grow out of it.
I really miss my dog. We had to put her down.
That sucks. What was his name?
Barney. He was such a good boy.
Barney was the name of my hamster.
I was very anxious to start driving at 16.
I know that feeling. It's nerve racking trying to incorporate everything you learned at the DMV in real time.
It really is. It's like I can't remember all the rules of the road.
It's also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time_comma_ that would definitely get me nervous.
I cannot wait to see Taylor Swift in concert!
My wife_comma_ LOVES taylor swift.
I actually went to high school with her. I cannot believe she is as famous as she is.
That is awesome_comma_ I went to high school with Brett Favre! Small world.
A female coworker came onto me at work the other day_comma_ but I refused her advances because I love my wife.
I am glad you love her_comma_ it must be a nice feeling
Yes_comma_ I just can't see myself being with another woman.
That is a good thing then
I cant believe I got arrested for a DUI this weekend_comma_ I let myself down.
That wasn't smart.
I know I promised myself I wasn't going to drink anymore.
Why did you then?
I feel good about my last semester. I think I'll do better in my engineering classes this fall.
Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?
I'm doing mechanical_comma_ it's pretty hard but it's interesting. A career in the field would be awesome!
Yeah_comma_ I think once you get in the field_comma_ you're set. The jobs seem to pay well. Good luck with that_comma_ you sound like you know what you're doing.
Thanks_comma_ I hope I can keep it up_comma_ good luck to you as well!
I hate taking the but_comma_ today I was late to my stop and got there just as it drove away....
Oh_comma_ the bus? Yeah I bet that was a little embarrassing. Sorry to hear that. I take my car for granted. Maybe you will get one someday.
I drove my parents' old car for a little_comma_ and i definitely took that for granted until it broke down lol. I'm trying to save up_comma_ I hope I get one too.
Well_comma_ keep working at it. It's a process.
Absolutely. I also enjoy biking around sometimes because its green and gets you some exercise.
I can't wait until I see my golden retriever Blue this weekend!
Where has he been?
I live away from my parents_comma_ he lives with them.
Oh I bet you are excited then! He will be happy too!
Yup goldens are happy about pretty much anything lol :) Do you have any pets?
I saw a colleague stealing money at work. I wonder if I did the right thing by not telling my boss.
Is there a reason why you didn't tell your boss?
I just didn't want to be labeled as a snitch_comma_ but now I'm having second thoughts.
Is there a way you could report it anonymously?
I hate when it rains_comma_ especially for several days at a time.
Oh I do too! I like a nice sunny day.
How has the weather been where you are.
It's been really rainy. My power just went out awhile ago.
Oh no_comma_ does that happen a lot when it rains near you?
Yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest.
Hopefully it doesn't rain this week but the forecast is at least 60% all week!
I remember when we used to compete with Yo-Yo's to see who could do the best tricks.
My brother used to have a yo-yo! He did a trick called "Around the world" and also one called "The cradle." Know those?
Yes_comma_ my favorite was called "Walk the dog".
Oh yeah! I remember that! I wasn't good at doing any of them. I mostly just watched him. Good memories.
Last week we were at an amusement park and I cant believe my little brother got on the roller coaster with us. He's usually afraid of heights.
Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high. He sounds really brave!
I know_comma_ he usually never goes on dangerous rides.
Did he go on anymore after that?
My son got spaghetti all over himself at dinner at a restaurant one night.
Well he's young_comma_ so you can't really fault him.
I didn't really care too much. I had remembered to pack him an extra set of clothes though.
That's good. You seem like a great parent.
I hate when it is storming it makes me so uncomfortable.
does it happen often in your part of the country?
Yes especially in the summer time storms are bad and hurricanes are at a high I hide under my covers lol.
wow.  i can only imagine
I was using the toilet at Walmart yesterday and somebody walked in on me.
Thats nuts.
Whats worse is that I was in the wrong restroom. It was the girls restroom. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could.
Did she scream?
I was finally going to get to see dolphins up close.
Did you get to? What happened?
I went to Sea World for the very first time. We got to feed the dolphins.
I have never been there! Sounds fun_comma_ but I don't support Sea World and the way they treat their animals.
Last week there was a huge tarantula on my wall. I thought it was going to jump on me.
OH GOSH! I would burn the whole house down. i'm terrified of spiders and bugs
OMG me too! I hit it with a rolled up news paper and a bunch of baby spiders came out. I had a panic attack and stomped on them.
i would have a heart attack!
I will never forget the first time I felt old. I saw a video of grandparents playing with grandchildren and I realized it had been awhile since I did those things.
I know how you feel. Life is too short.
yes_comma_ I try to remind myself that I still have a lot to offer.
Yes_comma_ you do! Just keep living everyday like your last.
Yesterday we had a pool party. My brother got drunk and did a back flip off the roof and landed in the pool.
wow_comma_ I never did understand why people want to get drunk in the first place. I sure hope he wasn't hurt.
I wasn't mad at him. I just never knew he was that athletic.
it does sound like an amzing feat
I got on social media yesterday and saw that my friends went to a party_comma_ but they didn't invite me.
ohh that's rough...did you talk to them about it
No_comma_ sometimes I feel like they just don't understand me.
do they give you any kind of value...or do they just ignore you / put you down 90% of the time?
Awhile back I was taking a relative to get a heart cath. The surgeon sent for me to enter the operating room.
Is your relative okay now?
oh yes_comma_ thank you for asking. other family members just got a call and told them everything went ok. Kind of scary when I was sent for.
It must've have been. Glad they are okay now.
I got teary eyed when I watched my little brother get his diploma at graduation.
Congratulations to him! You must be proud.
I am_comma_ every time he succeeds_comma_ I succeed. I love my big headed brother.
He's very lucky to have you.
I was supposed to drive a friend to work
oh yeah what happened?
I forgot to pick him up as I overslept
omg is he upset?
A friend needed help moving
So did you help him / her
Yeah_comma_ he didn't know of anyone else to turn to for help so I gave him a hand
That's pretty nice of you
Yesterday my friend bought the Ferrari I always wanted. I deserve it more than him.
Wow_comma_ thats a nice car
Yes_comma_ I don't know how a clown like him ended up with one before I did.
It happens sometimes I guess
I was thinking about my old neighborhood
Memories.. what state?
Can't say_comma_ but I was mostly just thinking about the friends I had there growing up
I understand but memories are always nice.
I needed to use my car to drive somewhere_comma_ but couldn't
What happened with your car then?
My car was hit while parked
Ugh! that stinks! Did you found out who did it?
I was at a Journey concert with my son and he had to go to the bathroom while they were switching out performers.
I would love that show
It was a very good show_comma_ but the people were so rude. We had to squeeze through a crazy crowd and didn't make it to the bathroom in time.
Oh well_comma_ it happens
i am suffering from severe fever for the past two days i don't have any energy
Have you been to the doctor?
yes i had. he prescribed medicine for curing
You will be fine then
i will take care of my self. thank you so much for your concern. take care of you too.
Sometimes I'm surprised my son is actually my son. He currently has enough merit aid to pay for 2/3 of his college tuition!
Well that is quite the accomplishment.
It is certainly much better than I was ever able to do.  I think my scholarship was $500 and I had no merit aide.  He set his academic bar high... I just told him to do his best.
He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well.
I now have a new boss_comma_ and today was my first day of a leadership meeting with him.  You never know how you will be received.
Oh man_comma_ that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?
He spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations_comma_ and I have to say_comma_ I agreed with all but one of them.  That's pretty good.  He spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other_comma_ so I think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet.
Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out_comma_ but that may be me speaking too prematurely
My mother will be 85 in a few days. My sister planned a surprise party knowing the day_comma_ hour and location would be very difficult for me to attend.
I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.
It is day after tomorrow and I am still not certain I can work it out. Sometimes people are very inconsiderate.
That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it.
My cousin just called with the craziest story. She and her family are locked inside a cemetery.
Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?
They had gone to a fair and decided to stop on their way home and walk around. I guess her husband lost track of time. The worst thing is they haven't eaten anything since about noon.
Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?
You hope your teens make the right choices_comma_ but sometimes even the right choices feel wrong.  He is choosing to be away with friends and not at home much.  I believe this is healthy_comma_ but I can help but want something different.
I know it is hard to start letting go_comma_ but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry_comma_ you are not alone.
That's what my own mother says.  In fact_comma_ she said my dad had a harder time than she did when I called and said_comma_ "Hey_comma_ I'm staying the night at so and so's_comma_ be back tomorrow."  I guess I will survive!  Hopefully he will choose to spend time here as he hits his 20s!
Yeah_comma_ they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.
I witness a great sight. I saw a gas station attendant leave his post to pump gas for a lady who has a hard time getting around.
That's really sweet. We don't have gas station attendants here. But that's nice that they're that helpful.
The one I refer to is more like a cashier. He is supposed to stay in a little shack and collect money and turn the pumps on. The lady offered him a tip and he wouldn't take it.
Ohh_comma_ that makes sense. Yeah_comma_ then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess there's good in the world after all.
I have been fortunate to live a good life but I found a lump in my neck.  Most people would get it checked out immediately.  I waited.  I was scared to get the news.
I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad_comma_ I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?
I finally went to an ENT doctor in May.  They biopsied it_comma_ and that was the most nerve-wracking five days I have ever waited.  It WAS good news_comma_ but still had to have removed.
I'm so glad to hear it was good news_comma_ though!
Even when life is tough and seems very unfair I have done my best to care for my family.
Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute_comma_ so cherish those you love!
It can be difficult. But I learned early on retaliating helps nothing.
It doesn't help us no. But you must take care of yourself too- Take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!
I am off work for a month in the summer_comma_ but I today was my first day back_comma_ and it felt great to be back on a routine!
Coming back to work could be good after a break.
A month is a great break to "get away from the daily grind" but believe me_comma_ at the end of week one you think oh_comma_ I have all the time in the world_comma_ and you aren't as productive.
I understand
I still can't believe I did that. My power had been off and I didn't even realize it.
That isn't good.
I arrived at church just as everyone was leaving. Boy did I feel awkward
Did anyone help you?
When I was pregnant_comma_ I thought so much about what my son would make me feel!
I wish I could feel that feeling_comma_ (unfortunately_comma_ I am a man). What did you end up naming your son?
I named him George_comma_ men can have feelings of their sons too. Hopefully one day you will as well.
I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.
Thank you! My husband was excited when I was pregnant_comma_ but I don't think he got it until he arrived.
Have you ever been hospitalized? It's not much fun. I had a mini stroke and was stuck there for a few days.
I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?
I am 99% me  The hardest part of the hospitalization was at the end of the day when my last visitor would go home. I am not good at being alone.
Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.
I have a full time job that doesn't pay anything.
That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?
I love my job_comma_ it involves my five year old kid and my eighty year old grandma.
Well_comma_ as long as you're doing something you enjoy_comma_ that's all that really matters.
It does! I love being there with my family.
I have a table that is somewhat unsteady_comma_ I put my computer on there because I have no where else to put it.
Have you figured out what's the problem?
I have not_comma_ it seems to do ok except when my son puts his foot on there even though I tell him repeatedly not to do that!
Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent?
It could be_comma_ I just hate when he doesn't listen!
My 2 year old daughter keeps picking up random words lately.
Yes? thats so cute_comma_ but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them
I know!  She said the f word!
OMG_comma_ well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them_comma_ and also when you are not with them!
I went to a concert last weekend and saved the tickets.
Are you keeping it as a souvenir?
I am_comma_ I plan to scrapbook it once I get the pictures back.
Nice_comma_ I do that sometimes with movie tickets if it's a great movie that I enjoed a lot.
We recently went camping.  Everyone definitely gets closer in such close quarters!
I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?
We went by a lake.  I accidentally opened the bathroom door with someone in it!
Oh wow! I bet the person inside would've pooped his pants_comma_ but there was probably none left!
This Spring has really made me appreciate family.
What happened?? Did you guys went camping or something?
My grandmother fell ill_comma_ and passed away.
Ho_comma_ I am sorry to hear that.
I got a notification on my phone that I had a package delivered and went to look for it
Too late I already took it. Just kidding_comma_ did you find it?
I did_comma_ they left it sitting in the middle of the driveway so it could get run over!
Oh_comma_ that's bad. Was there anything important in it?
It was some pills for my dog_comma_ luckily I found it before it got run over.
My son and wife are coming for a visit. Been a long time since I have seen them
Wao thats so cool you must so excited_comma_ how long has it been?
about a year. I am on the east coast and they moved out west
Wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son_comma_ sorry
I went to a hockey game with my five year old son earlier this year. I had to bring lots of supplies!
Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?
When I have my son with us I do! My husband was shocked when he said he wanted his blanket and I pulled one out of my purse!
Thats funny. Well at least it sounds like you are always prepared.
I have been married for ten years. Since we aren't swingers_comma_ I'm a one man kinda lady.
That's cool. I am not a swinger either.
Staying with the same guy day in and day out over a long period of time can be tough.
How did you do it?
It's a commitment to stay with just one person.
After a full year of trying to get a leak fixed_comma_ I got help from a neighbor's roofer_comma_ who "knew a guy."  He said the guy didn't work on roofs_comma_ so I was confused!
That makes no sense.
Exactly!  The roofer told me that since I replaced my roof and the leak was still there_comma_ the problem had to be my fireplace chimney.  He said stone chimneys often develop leaks.  As it turns out_comma_ this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock.  For $300 he made and installed the "gutter" on site_comma_ and I have had NO leaks!
That seems like a good price.
its so hot here. i've had to shower like 3-4 times a day cause you start sweating anyway and it feels icky. Hows the temperature at your place?
right now it's freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because it's coold
what? where the hell do you live? what do you mean its freezing? oh my god i am so jealous
haha i live in virginia where right now the temperture outside is muggy 85 degress just regular ac pumping in my home
ooooh you have an AC_comma_ thats why. I live in europe and AC's...arent a thing at all_comma_ only the occasional pharmacy will have an AC
aw man that must suck how do you huys keep cool through the summer
we dont_comma_ icecream and cold drinks is literally it.
Oops. I meant I was upset when my dog died.
I'm sorry_comma_ How long has it been?
Happened in Febuary.
That's always a tragedy.
Yea she was 12 yaers old_comma_ and had cataracts_comma_ so I knew it would happen someday
Last week_comma_ my girlfriend invited me to meet her parents. The whole time I was on edge because I wanted to make a good impression.
That's nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go?
Well we had dinner and the whole time a was stuttering because her father was asking very personal questions_comma_ but I think they liked me.
It probably went well_comma_ despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people.
We love going on our annual family camping trip_comma_ and just got back from it!
Oh nice! How long did you guys stay?
We went for a week_comma_ but did have to come back to town once.
Oh no_comma_ What happened?
Nothing bad.  We actually purchased a house to pick up and move_comma_ and they drove it down the road the week that we were on vacation.
I really love being in the great outdoors with my family!
Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?
We went camping_comma_ yes.  We're in the Midwest_comma_ so no mountains_comma_ unfortunately.  But we were near a lake.
Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?
We were out there for a week.
I did well on a project for a company
Did you get anything extra_comma_ like a bonus or a trip.
I think I might get promoted based on the work
Great. What business is it?
I was on my way home when a car drove through a huge puddle near the sidewalk
I can tell where this is going.
I got completely drenched_comma_ it was terrible
That has never happened to me. Thank god!
I am a stay at home mom. School just started.
Well does that make you anxious?
It does_comma_ this is my only child and he is going to kindergarten.
Oh_comma_ that would be rough. I've been through that too.
How did you make it through?
A close friend of mine has to leave the state for work
Are you happy for him?
Kind of_comma_ it's going to be sad since I won't see him again most likely
But if is a great opportunity for him_comma_ you should be happy.
A friend was able to fix a problem I was having
That's very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?
Computer problem.  It was something I couldn't figure out on my own
Bah_comma_ those newfangled computers. It's nice to have a tech saavy friend.
My coworkers sometimes put more work on me than necessary.
Why do you think they do that?
They don't want to talk on the phone and can get away with it for a while.
That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.
I agree_comma_ I'm actually up for a new position so if that happens they'll actually have to do work for a change.
I moved to tornado alley a few years ago. I'm not used to large tornadoes so I was pretty scared when it started storming.
Oh man_comma_ I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes.
We aren't too far south of Kansas in Oklahoma. We have had to spend a few evenings in the storm shelter. I guess stuff can be replaced.
Jeeeze_comma_ yea_comma_ it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?
I love it here_comma_ except for the tornadoes and snakes.
It's awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Here's hoping we both can live long_comma_ happy_comma_ and fulfilling lives!
I can't believe I spent 2 hours in the car just to arrive to surf and no waves to be seen.
That must be so disappointing. Is there something else you can do to have fun?
Kiteboard but I left half the gear at home. The surf report said 10 foot waves and it's flat water. Not cool bro_comma_ not cool
Sounds like you really like the water. So what do you do now?
Go to the surf bar I guess.
In 6 days I leave for Peru
Wow! I've never been anywhere near there.
It's a surf trip. They have monster waves. I'm nervous.
I've been to the ocean a few times but I've never even seen a surfer. We had a small boogie board.
Do you live inland?
I live in Tennessee
I've been river surfing in Tennessee. You have some decent white water rivers that offer boating and also surfing.
Wow. I must have a boring life then_comma_ because I have only seen tug boats and barges on the Mississippi.
Every single morning one lady on my team comes into my office and cry's
Oh no! How come?
You guess is as good as mine. She's crazy. Today she was stressed. Mind you she is 22 lives at home and has no bills.
Oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally. You never know how someone's home life is like.
She did mention this morning that her doctor said she needs meds or locked up.
Aw well it's likely bipolar- I know a phew. They have a hard time even on meds.
Yesterday before work she got in a fist fight with her equally crazy mother before work over salted peanuts.
I can't decide how to spend the $100. I found next to my car this morning.
I would save some and maybe get something you need/want?
Don't really need anything but it was a great way to start the day.
For sure! Any extra money is always good!
I'm thinking easy come easy go. Maybe do something fun this weekend I'm normally to broke to do.
I can't I went out with my ex's best friend while we were dating. I was a jerk but it was Karma biting her in the butt.
Had she done that to you before?
Right before that I found out she was seeing other people while I was in Iraq.
What a shame!
Yea_comma_ it worked out for the best. A few months after that I meet my wife and we have been together for 11 years now. First baby is on the way in December.
Congratulations!
Got on the scale this morning. Thanks to work stress I lost 15 pounds.
Oh man! I wish work stress would make me lose weight lol. I gain! Are you looking for a new job?
Yes_comma_ that or a new boss. I love my job but my boss is terrible.
Oh I don't deal with that well. I hope you get a new boss!
I give it to the end of the year. By that time I'll be slim thanks to all the weight I'll loose and then look for a new job.
I can see the kid's car from here. He is 16 and has a car work 100k
Wow_comma_ what brand
Bmw 8 series. It's my neighbors kid.
That is a nice car
Yea. I was his age in 2000. I drove a 30 year old rust bucket.
Do you see a man and that yea he's got it going on?
Yeah all the time. I get so jealous
Yea well I lost 25 pounds and now i'm that guy. Happy in my skin.
Wow_comma_ that is hard to do. Congratulations my dude!
Thanks. It was rough I love desert but no desert food for 6 months.
Last time I climbed Elbert I started getting sick from altitude. Heading to Colorado next week to try to climb it again.
That sounds awesome!  Is Elbert a fourteener?
Yes_comma_ it's the tallest in Colorado. This will be my 3rd time climbing it. But the first time since I got old and Lazy.
Hahaha.  Well_comma_ I hope you don't get sick.  Take something salty with you_comma_ maybe that will help.  Have fun!
Last time I arrived and tried to climb it the same day. My head felt like it was going to explode.
Aced my Real Estate Exam today. Now I'm licensed in two states.
Congratulations. I bet you're happy!
Yea_comma_ time to advance my career now.
Do you work for a company or on your own?
I'm self employed but new to the business.
Cool beans
I was recently waiting to hear from my old apartment about my security deposit refund. I needed the money to pay my new pet deposit_comma_ and wasn't sure if I'd get enough money back.
Were you able to get it back?
I was_comma_ and I ended up getting enough to pay the deposit and then some.
That's great! I bet that was a relief.
I was watching a video about a man who made a small table out of chocolate. It looked real and was just amazing.
Wow_comma_ that should have been amazing
It really was. It also made me want to eat chocolate.
Me too_comma_ I love chocolate
I was so happy to watch my friend do a backflip
I've always been too scared to do a backflip. I always worry I'm going to break my neck or something. Did it take him a long time to get it right?And did he get hurt?
I think he just took gymnastics classes. He luckily did not get hurt!
Oh_comma_ that makes sense. And I'm glad to hear that. I always worry about that sort of thing. You ever think about trying to do it netx?
I hope the next doctor's appt. that I have goes well. Sometimes they aren't the greatest experience.
Are you sick?
Yeah_comma_ I have health problems_comma_ it's complicated.
That sucks_comma_ I will pray for you.
Thank you_comma_ I appreciate you being kind.
I can't believe I walked in on someone using the restroom.
Oh my_comma_ that must've been an embarrassing situation!
It was! I knocked first and no one answered_comma_ so I thought it was okay to go in.
That's ok_comma_ you did the right thing. It probably happens to lots of people.
Thanks_comma_ I'm sure it does haha
So remember I told you_comma_ that I've lost my phone for a moment on a subway?
Yes_comma_ what about it?
So i guess I just dropped it_comma_ and a very old man_comma_ picked it up and gave it back to me
That was nice of him.
I woke up today to a bit of a strange sight.
Tell me all about it.
Well_comma_ it was still dark and too early_comma_ but I felt like I had enough sleep.
I try to always go for extra sleep.
The party that was thrown for me was for my 30th. I think it made friends and family just as happy as it made me.
Wow! 30th is a big milestone birthday! I can imagine that everyone was excited to get to share that with you.
Thank you! I was glad to share that moment with them.
Did you feel old after?
Haha_comma_ not really. I feel older now.
i was frustrated because i could not print a document_comma_ and a co worker showed me a keyboard shortcut to find it everytime.
That had to be relief. So now you won't have to deal with that frustration again.
Yes indeed_comma_ it was frustrating!  I didn't have time to mess with it everytime i had to print something.
Those keyboard shortcuts can be lifesavers.
Yes they can. I have become much more productive as a result.
Some things have changed in my life and my close friends have family have helped me through_comma_ which I really appreciate.
Thats good. Everyone isnt so fortunate.
For sure_comma_ thank you. Times can change very unexpectedly.
Its goof to have support when it does change.
Definitely_comma_ I think we all need to support each other better in this world.
Exactly
Hopefully we can find some kindness in the world and get the support we all need.
We would all be better people then
One day I randomly got a raise_comma_ not something I was expecting!
oh wow. Bet it felt amazing. was it a mistake?
Thanks! It wasn't a mistake. Just unexpected and pretty neat!
sounds like a great day. makes you wish it would happen everyday
I definitely wish that could happen!
I was at the store and accidentally knocked over some items. I could feel my face turning red.
That's so embarrassing! What did you do?
I picked them up and tried to move to another area!
Did anyone say anything?
I don't think so. I seem to do these things quite often.
Well at least you got away with it this time!
Haha_comma_ I think as long as I put them back_comma_ no one minds.
I was flying alone_comma_ even though I had before_comma_ this particular time I felt wary.
Really? Why was that?
I think I felt concerned that the plane would crash or that something else bad might happen.
Do you normally feel like that when you fly?
I do sometimes_comma_ but this time it was even more so.
I was traveling on a plane by myself and I felt kind of scared.
I can understand that_comma_ flying is scary.
It is. We ended up going through a thunderstorm.
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.
Thank you! There was a lot of turbulence_comma_ so that was not fun.
Hello!
Hey_comma_ do you have anything on your mind?
Yeah! i just received an email from guild wars 2 customer support_comma_ I lost my game code so i couldnt recover my account (forgot password)_comma_ and they sent an email back asking me for the code. its so surprising having to deal with people this stupid_comma_ you would think that they would never get hired to begin with
I agree_comma_ incompetent customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems.
its so surprising though_comma_ They were hired to do ONE thing_comma_ and then they fail at that one thing_comma_ how did you get hired D: online stores have a similar problem with indians - I have nothing against them but the people online stores elect to hire are ones who cant speak english which results in your problem never getting solved cause they dont understand you.
I recently lost my dog_comma_ after 13 years.
oh I am so sorry for your loss.
Yeah_comma_ it was terrible.  Heart wrenching to bury him.
I bet. You gave him a good long life_comma_ that was the best you could do.
When a spot came open for a supervisor job at my employer_comma_ that was a stressful week for me.
I am sorry it was so stressful
They had many qualified candidates and it took a full week for them to make their decision.
Just hope for the best
I had to work the day that my boyfriend and his family went to a Christmas party.
ugh thats the worst right.. everyone should have holidays off.
It wasn't even a holiday_comma_ just on a Saturday during the day because the drive was so long.
I say skip work next time :p go for it
When my daughter was a baby she couldn't talk so I taught her sign language.
i just love that_comma_ my son knows ASL
That's great! I taught her a few words that were interesting to her so she could tell us what she needed.
i wish schools would teach kids asl
Yeah_comma_ me too that would be nice for them to learn.
My sister in law planned a get together during a time we couldn't go.
she wants to spend time with you
Well no_comma_ she knew we couldn't go out late because of my son's bedtime and scheduled it anyway.
that was nice of her
My mother in law wanted to take my daughter to Colorado_comma_ but she is only 3.
its a beautiful place
I'm sure it is_comma_ but she is very young and still looks for me in the morning.
in that case i agree then
We were going on vacation and I made a list of everything we could possibly need when we were there.
Where are you going on vacation?
We went to New Jersey_comma_ so a long way for us. We had a toddler_comma_ so I had to make sure I had everything for her.
That is close for me_comma_ but it is a fun time!
I seem to be always alert_comma_ so that even something loud happens_comma_ I remain calm.
i admire that
I just wander_comma_ is this normal?
no its not
I have been having bad Anxiety for months. I cante seem to get a to stop.
I see_comma_ have you tried yoga and meditation?
Nope.But have been practicing breathing and muscle relaxation
Keep a positive mindset and your anxieties will be relieved!
I hope so.Thank you for youre support.
I was having my second baby and my friends threw me a baby shower without me knowing.
Oh my_comma_ you must have very surprised!
Yes_comma_ I was not expecting it at all. They invited us over to hang out.
It must have been an enjoyable day. You have nice friends!
I couldn't sleep on Christmas eve. I was ready to see my daughter's face when she woke up in the morning.
i bet she was so excited!! Did she love her presents?
Yeah she did_comma_ but I guess I was looking forward to it more than she was.
that was me last christmas lol my son was only 9 months old but i bought so many presents and i was so excited to see his reaction
I really like my job. I'm worried that I will lose it.
Oh no. Why are you worried to lose it?
I don't have as much work to do as in the past and no one needs help with anything.
Oh no.. That is a bit scary. I wish the best for you!
Thanks! I hope more work will come soon. Are you doing well?
I am_comma_ thank you for asking!
I ordered a pizza today_comma_ but it really wasn't a pleasant experience.
Oh no_comma_ why not?!
The guy that took my order was rude_comma_ but I understand_comma_ most people can't control themselves...
They really can't. It's still no excuse though.
I can't believe my friend wouldn't answer her phone when I waited over an hour for her to pick me up!
Oh that sucks...did she explain herself yet
No_comma_ she just completely blew me off. I found out she was out on a date instead and didn't tell me.
Sounds like you need a new friend or your own car...or both lol
My neighbor is the worst! He has a dog that he just keeps chained up in the backyard_comma_ and he rarely feeds it. Last week I saw it and he looks anorexic.
That's terrible.  Someone should call animal control on them.
I know_comma_ what kind of human being would do that to a poor dog! I'm going to call animal control soon.
I hope they do something to help that poor puppy.
i was so shocked by the behavior of my friends dog
what happened ?
when i knocked on the door i felt the door was open and i thought as he is in home itself i felt i can go in but suddenly his dog jumped on me
did he end up biting you??
no he but he pushed me with his legs and body he was so strong
My dog got really sick and was coughing up blood last week. I didn't know what to do. I had a panic attack.
Oh no_comma_ that's terrible!  Are both you and your dog alright now?
Yes_comma_ I took him to the vet and got him the help he needed. The possibility of losing my best friend had me frightened!
Yes_comma_ that would have frightened me too.  I'm glad he's alright now.
Financially_comma_ things will turn around for my family soon!
I hope and wish so. In this tough economic climate many are finding it difficult to cope with financial responsibilities
Yes_comma_ and we had a layoff of five months.  I believe in a brighter day_comma_ though_comma_ so I know it will improve.
Being optimistic will help you alleviate much of your accumulated stress
I was in a check out lane for a while waiting when another cashier comes alone and takes the people in the back of the line.
that is literally the worst_comma_ the people should have atleast told you to go ahead  first!
Oh I know. People just gladly go_comma_ but the cashiers should be taught to take the next person in line.
its really so rude. ugh im sorry
I love hanging out with my dog in nature_comma_ it makes me feel good.
I love dogs too what breed do you have ?
I have a 4 yr old golden do you have any?
i have a german shepard
Awesome how old is he/she?
Where at I am in life_comma_ currently_comma_ is at peace with everything around me. It is a first for me_comma_ and it is simply amazing.
That's awesome.  What did it take for you to get there
A lot of years struggling_comma_ and finalizing realizing that the struggle is the normal part of it all.  Acceptance and steadfastness led to happiness_comma_ I guess.
Sounds like you've gotten smarter and more observant over the years
I once saw a dead possum in my garbage it smelled terrible lol.
Oh how gross! I don't like possums anyways
Yeah me neither lol any wildlife where you live?
Just lizards and gators. I live in South Florida haha
Cool I lived there for 2 years_comma_ lizards were indeed everwhere.
Recently_comma_ I've been watching my son play a game called Fortnite. It blows my mind how good he is at such a fast game.
I have heard about that game.  I heard there was one guy that makes about $500_comma_000 a month playing it on the streaming service Twitch.  Maybe your son should give it a try.
I have never heard of Twitch.  That is a lot of money_comma_ I could retire!
Twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games.  I guess a lot of people really love watching good players.  Go ahead and retire now and get him started!
My friend got a promotion and moved to California last week. I always thought I would be the first one to get out of this dump.
I'm sorry your friend moved away. Sounds like me when I moved from Indiana to Florida. My friend was upset when I left too.
He doesn't deserve to live in luxury! He gets to chill on the beaches and I'm stuck out here in the dessert.
That is your friend_comma_ you should be happy for them!
I'm excited to go to school full time again in the fall!
Aw I am happy for you! What do you go to school for?
Engineering its tough but I think its really cool.
That is great! Good luck to you!
Thanks_comma_ anything you're looking forward to in the near future?
Watching my first child being born changed my life forever.
I bet! I can't imagine what that must be like to see a bran new life.
It changed my whole outlook on everything.  I have never felt such happiness condensed in such a short period of time/
That's awesome :) I'm happy for you! Hopefully one day I will get to see that
I stay home with my five year old son. Sometimes I hear things come out of his mouth that I know he learned from me.
Hopefully the things coming out of his mouth are good things_comma_ right?
I wish_comma_ he sometimes says curse words.
Oh.  I recommend correcting that before it gets out of hand.  Good luck!
Thanks! I was shocked that he picked up on that_comma_ my little playback machine!
I've been watching movie a few hours ago_comma_ and still feel its effects.
What movie were you watching?
I think it was called Rampage.
That is a great movie.
I had a great time hiking with my family and dog recently! Do you like nature?
I do.  It feels great to get out into nature doesn't it?
Yeah I always enjoy hiking in the mountains or just going to the beach.
The beach is my most favorite place to go.
I lived in South Florida for 2 years and the beach got old lol_comma_ but once I moved out I appreciated at a bit more.
When I moved to Texas I didn't know anyone but my boyfriend.
That sounds rough_comma_ were you able to get accustomed to Texas?
Yeah_comma_ but I had left all my family behind. I didn't know anyone here for quite some time.
I know what you mean_comma_ that happened to me when I left for college a few years ago.
We got a new girl in class yesterday and I bet my friends that I could get her number! Let's just say lunch was on them.
Wow that is really confident on your end. Are you going to do anything with the girl
Well that's the attitude you have when you look like Brad Pitt. Maybe take her out to the movies and try to get to second base.
That sounds exciting. Just make sure she is okay with it all before!
We were talking to my husband's grandma and she asked about the rain hitting us. I thought she was talking about the rain we got on the way to see her_comma_ but she wasn't.
What was she referring to then?
She was talking about the rain storms that hit earlier in the week_comma_ and asked if we were effected by them.
I see.  Do you get a lot of storms in your location?
Not too much_comma_ but when she asked I said we did_comma_ but we were talking about two different things.
I always hate that when you are never on the right wavelength with someone during a conversation
Yesterday we watched "The Land Before Time" in class. That movie brings back so many memories.
That movie is a classic! I loved it as a kid!
Yes_comma_ I remember we used to call one of my friends Petrie because he looked exactly like him.
Hahah! That is awesome!
My new hotel neighbors are very noisy.
get them reported
I might just do it_comma_ thank you.
You are welcome_comma_ if you take your stand they will  behave
My son starts kindergarten next week_comma_ I am a stay at home mom. I want to get caught up on scrapbooking my pictures of him!
I bet you're both excited and nervous about it! I have two kids of my own and one will be starting in about a year while the other is going to fourth grade.
I had all these plans when I had my son_comma_ they didn't work out but I am wishing that this does!
I'm sure it will! I hope it all works out for you.
I hope so as well. I am a few years behind.
I recently discovered that there are plenty of like minded people around where I live.
That's always a good thing. It means you should get on great with your neighbors.
Yes_comma_ Just knowing that I'm not alone is such a great feeling.
Most of my neighbors are good_comma_ kind people too_comma_ so I know just what you mean.
i felt anxious during my work. the finance related work which gives me satisfaction
Why did you feel anxious?
i love my job. i eagerly awaited to achieve and go  as long as i want in my life.
Hmm.. I'm a little confused.  Why were you anxious?
i am a workaholic person i want to achieve some more thing in my life. when i go to my work i feel active and energetic.
We were eating ice cream last night and my son walked over to a police officer and started talking to him.
Well that's sweet. How did the policeman react?
He was so nice_comma_ he even volunteered to set up a meeting with the mayor and my son!
Oh wow! That's awesome! Your son sounds like he has a bright future!
He was so excited! My husband and I were happy the police officer was so nice.
My took me white water rafting with him last week. When we got to the river I started having second thoughts.
I've done that before. Getting over that initial fear is really hard. But it's fun once you do!
I know_comma_ but since it was my first time I didn't know how to act. My mind started to go blank and I started to sweat profusely.
I understand completely. It's that initial anxiety. It's a scary thing to do!
I couldn't wait for my mom to finally get here from New Jersey. She would stay about a week and a half.
I bet you are pretty anxious and excited at the same time.
Yeah_comma_ she would be able to see the kids_comma_ and she hardly ever comes to visit.
its always nice when grandmas come visit.
Last week_comma_ my brother landed a 900 on his skateboard like Tony Hawk at a skating competition.
Oh wow_comma_ that sounds like it might be cool but I don't know what that looks like_comma_ what is the 900?
It's when you turn a skateboard 900 degrees while spinning in the air. It's very hard to do_comma_ so you can imagine the look on my face when I saw my brother do it.
Yea_comma_ how old is your brother?
We go camping a lot during the summer. My favorite piece of equipment is my hammock!
I love camping_comma_ and understand why a hammock is your favorite. They're so comfortable!
They are_comma_ I love to read a good book while hanging out in the hammock!
That sounds amazing_comma_ as long as you're not reading scary books about the woods!
I wouldn't do that! Just a good book_comma_ where I didn't have to think much!
I agree. Camping and hammocks are for relaxing and letting the mind be free.
I really enjoy going to Disney because it makes me feel very nostalgic for my childhood.
I've actually never gone there. What's it like?
It's pretty awesome! Lots to do for adults as well. I tend to go to Epcot quite often with my annual pass. We live right down the street.
That's good to hear. I do plan on taking my kids in the future!
Absolutely do! Memories of going to Disney with my parents were some of my fondest.
I was pretty shook up last year when Hurricane Irma came through Florida.
Do you live in Flordia? I have family down there and was really worried about them.
Yes_comma_ I live in Orlando so I was lucky that it was central_comma_ but we were out of power for a few days.
That was lucky. Losing power is bad_comma_ but at least that was it. Scary situation.
I really feel good when my friends keep my secrets. (Or at least I think they do!)
What will happen if the secret is told?
Not much_comma_ I just value my privacy. Do you have secrets that you tell your friends?
Of course_comma_ I only tell them the best ones though!
My sister in law got upset when she was over and I was trying to talk to her about it.
Oh no_comma_ was she upset at you or about something else?
About something else and I wanted to talk to her and make her feel better.
Well that's really kind of you to help her like that. She's lucky to have you!
I was at a concert a few weeks ago with my son and he had to go to the bathroom.  There were so many people there_comma_ mostly adults_comma_ and they refused to move so we could make it to the family bathroom.
Ugh_comma_ people can be so rude. Was he able to go to the bathroom?
He was not_comma_ there were just too many people standing around not moving.
That's awful!! So what did you end up doing? Did he just have to pop a squat?
He actually had an accident_comma_ because I didn't tell him to just go. Mommy of the year.
I'm really hopeful that I'll land a new promotion at work.
As long as you work hard and stay dedicated_comma_ I'm sure it will come!
I hope so! Hard work and dedication tend to pay off.
Absolutely! And if you trust your boss_comma_ I'm sure he will do the right thing.
As we were driving on the highway we got caught in a big storm.
Thats scary.  Did you have to pull over?
No we kept driving but the rain was real bad and trucks were swerving.
I take it you made it out safe beacuse we're here chatting
My parents told me that we would be going on a cruise vacation at Christmas. I couldn't believe it!
That sounds like an awesome Christmas present!  I've actually thought about doing that with my girls now that they are older and not much they really need.  Where are you going?
We went on the cruise in February. It was a Disney cruise in the Bahamas! What a great experience.
I've ALWAYS wanted to go on a Disney cruise - it's probably my dream vacation. I'm so jealous!!!
I was so glad when I graduated college
That's such a great accomplishment and such a relief at the same time. What was your major?
Communications. It was a little tough but not engineering tough!
I totally get that. I majored in business but sometimes I wish I majored in engineering. I'm kind of glad I didn't though. It's hard!
My family is so supportive. They even flew out when my last dog passed away and spent some time with me to make me feel better.
Aww_comma_ that is very nice of them. i just had to put mine down a few weeks ago.
I'm so sorry to hear that. What kind of breed was your dog?
Border Collie. Yours?
Yorkshire Terrier. She was a sweetheart.
I was very scared when flying for the first time
I can imagine! Did you end up having a good flight?
I did. Luckily no turbulance!
That's good! Hopefully you had a nice seatmate too!
My son starts school soon_comma_ we had a fun day out but when we got home he was really bad.
Aww_comma_ was he scared?
I don't think so_comma_ I think he was just over the day and it was too much for him.
I can see that. School is a challenging time for a kid.
I have heard that. Just bummed me out for the day.
I was very ready going into my test
Always good to feel ready for something like that. What subject was it in?
Engingeering. It was really tough!
Man_comma_ I remember those days. My engineering exams were killer. Did you do well on it?
Anytime we take a trip_comma_ I normally save what some people consider trash.
Another man's trash is another man's treasure! What things do you save?
Just different things that I can scrapbook_comma_ mementos from my trip.
I keep a scrapbook myself! I love collecting stamps. Got any trips planned this year?
My pants feel down when riding my bike
I'm so sorry that happened to you. How did you handle this situation?
I just pulled them up. it was just embarassing.
I hope no one saw that_comma_ it must've been terrible.
I was scared to go to school
How are you going to learn! Why are you afraid to go?
Just nervous about all the people
It ain't so bad. I'm sure you'll make a few new friends and everything will be just fine.
I was scared of going into the caves
Please describe what scared you about the caves.
Just the darkness.
That seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves!
We live in a very high cost of living area but don't make a ton of money.
Is there anyway you can move to somewhere more affordable?
I'm not sure_comma_ sometimes I wish I had what the other people around me had.
I do too but it's natural to get envious of others sometimes_comma_ don't put yourself down over it.
Sometimes people ask me to do a lot of other stuff when I already have a lot on my plate.
That must be so annoying. I get that sometimes too.
I feel like people don't care that I have stuff to do.
I'm sad to hear that_comma_ I'm sure there is someone who cars.
My son went to the best preschool. When I needed him to stay late_comma_ they always had space for him.
That's good to hear that you care for your son so much. I am sure he will be quite an intelligent child going to the best of the best.
I hope so_comma_ it really helps to get your village when you have kids.
Yeah_comma_ my village helped with my son's preschool tuition as well. Strength in numbers and good neighbors!
I was so grossed out when I saw someone vomit
Oh yuck! Where did that happen?
At Fazolis. It was so gross.
During dinner? ACK!
hello
Can you tell me about your recent experience?
i couldnt believe it when i heard they are making even more new star wars movies
Yeah_comma_ I love Star Wars. I was sad when Han Solo died. He was my favorite character!
i agree it was very sad. i dont know what they will do with the new films
My husband went to go hang out with his guy friends leaving me all alone.
That would make me sad_comma_ did you let him go?
Yeah_comma_ I mean I didn't want to tell him he couldn't. I just don't like being by myself.
I know how you feel_comma_ I'm sorry about that_comma_ at least he probably came back pretty quickly.
I felt upset when I forgot to ask my friend to dinner.
I'm sure they will understand. You can always have another dinner_comma_ that's the beauty of life!
That is true. Good way to look at things!
Where did you end up going?
Tomorrow's my last day of work. I can't believe it. I wish I had something lined up.
Oh no_comma_ have you look at other options?
I have and tried negotiating with my old work. I have an interview next week with another company so I hope that goes well!
I really hope you get it!
I was so mad when some guy cut me off in traffic!
Oh no. Did you flip him off?
No_comma_ I remained calm_comma_ but I was very mad!
That was probably for the best anyway. People who drive like that are the worst_comma_ though.
i couldnt stand it when my neighbor was using power tools at 8 am on a saturday
Wow_comma_ that's super annoying! I understand wanting to get things done early_comma_ but that's not very respectful to neighbors.
nope_comma_ it was very frustrating_comma_ he lives next door too
Have you talked to him about it?
yes i did_comma_ he hasnt done it since
I'm pretty worried about what the future will hold. I lose my job tomorrow. Trying to keep my head up!
are you getting laid off?
Yes_comma_ unfortunately. We are having a huge company layoff and being a remote employee didn't help my case.
im sorry_comma_ i hope you're able to find an even better job immediately
I was really scared when Hurricane Irma came through Florida last year. It was a pretty horrible experience.
Do you live in Florida?
I do_comma_ in Orlando. I feel lucky to have had no damage to my home and been in a central location_comma_ but the storm was awful and we had no power for 4 days.
Wow_comma_ that sounds terrifying. You are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though.
I work online to make extra money for things my family wants.
Thats amazing_comma_ you must be a good person
It's nice to be able to pay for fun things that our budget doesn't allow us to normally do.
How many kids do you have?
i felt bored being by myself all week
Sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me. Alone can be good.
it was just boring because i had so much work to get done
Well at least you didn't have a lot of people under foot to slow you down. So I hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it.
My son's school starts next week and they just changed the first day of school!
I am so sorry to hear that!
My husband had to ask off for a different day without much notice!
That is the worst. At least you and your husband got something worked out for your son's first day at school!
I was looking through my cloud and found some pics of when I was little.
A walk down memory lane.
Yeah_comma_ it makes me miss being at home and around my family.
Oh I bet! It's always good to cherish those memories.
I was watching my favorite tv show and my husband kept talking to me during it.
oh that can be annoying_comma_ did you tell him anything?
I just gave him a look. The thing is he says I do that instead of waiting til commercial_comma_ but then he goes and does it to me.
hahah that's kinda funny. Maybe he just missed you!
I was glad my dad asked me to go on a mission trip with him.
Nice! Where did you go?
Belize. He did doctor stuff. I didn't do much. But it was cool to see what they were up to.
Oh_comma_ that is really cool! What a great experience_comma_ and fun to bond with your dad!
i was upset sitting in traffic yesterday
Was it long?
about an hour
That's long_comma_ I understand the reason behind you being upset
My friends were finally coming over to visit_comma_ it had been a long time since I saw them last.
I know how you feel_comma_ it's always good to bond with your buddies when you can
Yeah_comma_ I really miss seeing them since they moved.
Thank God you will be able to tell them in person about how much you miss them
i have good memories when i see photos of my grandmother
Oh yea_comma_ I can relate to the good times_comma_ is she still alive?
no unfortunately she isnt
oh no. May her soul rest in peace
Well last week my husband and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary.
Congrats! I'm sure you will have great memories.
We do.  10 years being loyal and true to each.  I just hope we have many more!
I believe you will just continue doing what you've already done.
thats true.  Are you married yet yourself?
Yes I am married
I hope you are as happy as I am.  Its nots easy though_comma_ a work in progress_comma_ but worth it all in the long run.
I am happy and yes its a lot of work. Anything worth having takes work to keep it.
I have a presentation tonight_comma_ I'm nervous but I still think I'll ace it.
HAve you been practicing? Do you have note cards?
I don't want to use note cards as I look better without them. I did use them while practicing though.
I hope you do well. IS it for school?
Thanks_comma_ yeah it is for a summer class in macroeconomics.
Well congratulation on your A in advance lol
Thanks I know ill get it lol.
A tarantula bit me in my living room the other day and I thought I was going to die.
Oh my gosh! Was it a wild tarantula or a pet?
It was a wild tarantula. I had my family rush me to the hospital_comma_ but I ended up being just fine. It only caused me discomfort for a couple of days.
Thank goodness! The biggest type of spider we have here if a wolf spider. They don't really bite you unless you irritate them.
Last week_comma_ my childhood friend came to visit from out of town. I couldn't stop smiling when we hung out.
Oh awesome! How are they doing?
Great. We were just cracking jokes the whole time. It was good to see him.
Awesome! It's nice to see people who knew you so long ago. No friendships like those!
Yesterday_comma_ my brother came out on the news because he was taking about the new charity he started. I'm glad I have brother with such a good heart.
Wow_comma_ that's really great. What charity did he donate to?
No_comma_ he's starting his own. I'm glad I'm able to call him my bro.
Oh_comma_ sorry. That's awesome. What does his charity support?
My daughter wanted to go outside and play so I sat out there with her.
Was the weather nice?
Yes it was nice outside. I felt very relaxed out there.
I can't wait until we get nice weather. ITs too hot to do anything
I was in a long line at the supermarket the other day. Then some lady just cut right in front of me like nothing.
Some people have no concept of being rude.
It mad me sick! Do they teach these people about manners?
no_comma_ they dont.
I was diagnosed with stage four cancer yesterday. The doctor told me I have less than a month to live.
Are you serious? That is extremely terrible news to hear. :(
Yes_comma_ I fell to my knees when I heard the news and haven't stopped crying since. My life is pretty much over!
I really wish I knew what to say_comma_ but even watching my mother go thru stage 4 I still dont know what to say! Spend a lot of time with your loved ones!
When my daughter was a baby she picked up sign language really well.
Really_comma_ isn't that unusual?
Not really_comma_ I was trying to teach her so she could communicate with us and tell us what she wanted.
I'm glad it worked out so well for you all .
Yesterday_comma_ I was at the doctors office all day waiting for my blood tests. I was hoping everything would turn out alright.
I know how stressful that can be. I hope everything turned out alright.
The wait turned out to be worth it because the results showed that everthing was fine.
That is great news!
I was so annoyed earlier - went back to get my car after doing my shopping and someone had hit it and driven off!
That wasn't nice. I hope they caught them.
No unfortunately not.  There were no cameras in the carpark and no one saw anything.  So i am left with the bill.  I hope karma gets them eventually though.
That sucks_comma_ how much is it?
Not sure yet_comma_ I have left it into garage to get priced up but its looks pretty bad.
I was applying for a manager position at the store I worked at. I felt really sure about the interview.
I can relate. You just have to be yourself.  Do you know if you got the job?
Yeah they offered me the job. I was very excited.
That’s great!  How do you like it?
i am really happy about the weather today
Is it sunny where you are ?
yes and warm but not too hot
Glad for you_comma_ it's cloudy and humid here.
that is unfortunate
My friends girlfriend kissed me at a party last week. It's been weighing heavy on my mind. Should I tell him?
Why did you wait a week? Tell her to tell him
But_comma_ he's been my best friend since childhood. I think I should be the one to tell him. I just feel so bad. That's why I postponed it.
I don't know. You should have told hime when it happended. Just do it and get uit out of the way so you both can move past it.
i got a letter from my grandmother in the mail today
That's nice. I always like getting letters.
did you ever have a pen pal when you were a child?
no_comma_ I never did. It might have been nice.
My friend won 58 million when he hit the jackpot the other day. I don't understand_comma_ why cant good stuff like that happen to me?
58 million. That's unbelievable.
I couldn't believe he won it because he's so stingy and I'm such a kind hearted person. I deserve it more!
Well_comma_ you know how to get it from  him right?
Yesterday_comma_ I went engagement ring shopping and I picked out the perfect ring for my wife.
ah congratulations on the engagement! How long have you two been together?
Thanks buddy. We have been dating for 2 years on and off. I can't wait to show her the ring. I like it a lot and I think she will too.
No problem. I hope she'll love it as well.
I was upset when my friend forgot to invite me to dinner
Oh no. Did you guys talk about it?
We did. He apologized_comma_ but I just hate that he forgot me.
No one's perfect. I hope you won't hold a grudge.
I had a major work presentation to give
How'd it go?
It went well_comma_ I felt like I had everything in order
Being prepared pays off soemtimes.
I took a work related placement test for a better position in my company
how did you do on it?
I did well overall_comma_ it was easier than I thought
Good_comma_ well I hope you get the better position!
Just started my budget. Apparently I'm going to be ok.
How strict is the budget?
Down the last dollar. I have a baby on the way so we've got to bank money
Ah_comma_ that makes sense_comma_ well I hope it goes well for you!
Thank's Im hopeful that we will be able to stick to it.
i was impressed by my nephews performance at his little league baseball game
Nice. Did his team finish first?
they won the game and he played really well
At his age_comma_ they progress very quickly
i really appreciated all the effort my friends put into my birthday
That's very nice of them! Having caring friends is very important.
yes it is
What did they do for you?
I'm over the road trucker. Man it gets boring in the evenings.
I bet it does_comma_ you should find a podcast you like
I listen to most of those as I drive. I was thinking of getting into gaming. I have a Tv in the truck and can buy a game system.
That is smart_comma_ I would recommend a nintendo switch!
Someone told me that on the CB. But I've never heard of it before earlier today. I've got to do something. The boredom is dragging me down.
I see a lot of work coming up at my job
How so?
My supervisor warned me earlier in the week about it
I'm sorry. Any way you can get out of it?
I was scared to fly for the first time
Why's that?
Because I am scared of heights.
Have you always been scared of heights?
i couldnt believe it rained this afternoon after such a sunny morning
Yuck!  You didn't get wet and muddy I hope!
nope it only rained for a few minutes
That is good to hear.  No one likes soggy shoes!
I was really proud of my friend for doing a backflip
Backflips are scary. Neck injury is serious.
Yes_comma_ but luckily he completed it without hurting anything.
Thats good! They do look cool too.
I was scared to fly for the first time
I was scared the first and only time I flew also. Where were you flying to?
Europe. So a long flight!
Oh wow! I bet that was really exciting. I have never been out of the country.
I feel bad for forgetting about my mom's birthday
You must feel horrible!  Get her something extra nice and I am sure she will forgive you!
What should I get her?
Get her flowers and a gift certificate to a nice massage place!
I was thinking about how I missed my grandma
I have the same feeling. I miss her also
She passed last year. She is in a better place.
Sorry to hear that
I have a work project coming up that needs to be completed
Are you going to have it completed in time?  I hope you are not behind schedule!
I still have much to be done
Ouch!  You better knuckle down and burn the midnight oil!
So I walked into work this morning. I have a new boss. He's 20 and had a PhD. I'm amazed.
Wow! I would be amazed too!
A little worried. While super smart as we get older we gain real world experience in dealing with people that you can not learn in a book. But still at 20 I was struggling with my associates degree.
That's so true. Im 30 and just now having the time to work on my bachelors. But I have a lot of work experience.
I'm 34 and still working on the BA as well. When life got in the way education had to take a back seat.
Same here. Well I hope he can adapt and do well. Good luck with your BA too!
So ever single day my boss is late to work. 20 minutes or more. Today I was 1 minute late_comma_ first time in 2 years and I got a wrote up.
Wow. That's pretty hypocritical.
Yea_comma_ I even called and let them know the highway was closed down and I was going to be late. I even text her photo of the traffic accident once I got up to it.
I think she's just trying to cause a problem.
I was hungry and took my co-workers food
Did you not have your own food?
I didn't have any that day_comma_ I was also out of money
Oh no! That sounds horrible! Did the co-worker find out?
This morning I don't know what got into me but on the way to work I picked up a homeless guy.
Oh wow. Give me the details.
Yea_comma_ as I pulled over I thought it was someone down on his luck. Nope_comma_ he was crazy.
Are you missing an organs?
Haha_comma_ it started off ok. He was going to the train station. I agreed to take him. With in minutes he was talking to him self.
Well_comma_ At least you're in one piece. you could have been in several.
Went on a first date last weekend. Had some sort of BBQ appetizer early in the date. Yummy_comma_ yea well not really!
Not really? How come?
Well_comma_ after about an hour I got up to pee. As I washed my hands I looked up and my face was covered with sauce. It looked like someone poured it on my face_comma_
Oh wow_comma_ the BBQ must be delicious.
yea_comma_ I will not see here again but I will be seeing the BBQ again this weekend.
Do you ever wake up and realize how lucky we are? I travel a lot and I just got back from Haiti. I'm convinced it's better to be poor in America then rich in Haiti.
That's a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted_comma_ especially when some people say it's in its "worst state in a long time." We're prisoners of the moment.
Those that criticize have not traveled the real world out side resort gates or into the third world. Then you see a real state that is in trouble.
Yeah_comma_ I guess you would know for sure_comma_ since you've seen it first hand. Especially a place like Haiti_comma_ that's just gets pounded with hurricanes. What brought you to Haiti_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
I travel a lot. My self and my wife try to see 2-3 new cultures a year.
Monday I was downtown for work. I was on my way home when a homeless man asked form some money. I went to reach for my wallet and it was gone.
I am sorry to hear that.Is there a chance you forgot your wallet home?
No it was stolen. So when I went to reach for it. The homeless man could tell something was wrong. He actually paid for my train ticket home. I end up seeing him again today. Took him out to lunch and gave him some money.
That story could become a movie script.
I really want to help him get his life together.
All I want in life this weekend is to sleep and I have to work.
That’s a bummer. Drink some coffee
Coffee dose even phase me anymore. The lack of sleep is making my soul sad.
Try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda
I'll try that.
This weekend was supposed to be my first weekend off in 2 months.
Is it not going to happen?
Nope_comma_ my boss who only works one weekend a month has decided this month she is not going to work any weekends.
That sucks.
Yea_comma_ she is not a very good boss and now I'm super bummed.
You should find another job. No use being miserable. Or tell her boss!
I recently took my ELS certification test. I studied really hard_comma_ so I'm sure I passed it.
What's ELS?
Sorry_comma_ ESL. It's English as a Second Language. It just means I am certified to teach students that don't speak fluent English.
Ah_comma_ gotcha. A few of my friends teach English to Chinese students online and I think they have taken ESL courses
I just moved into my new house and I am having a cockroach problem.
That really sucks! What do you have to do?
I'm just using Raid right now_comma_ but I will call an exterminator tomorrow. I hate bugs so I am freaking out a little bit.
I do too.  I am so sorry you are going through this
When I was in New York_comma_ I got to see STOMP. It was an amazing show.
Wow. I had that DVD.
I used to watch it in music class a lot. I am fascinated by the way they make music with everyday items.
I know. I wonder if they still do that show
This was just a few years ago_comma_ so hopefully.
I love my dad. He only made me pay half of the money I owed him and let me keep the rest for my pet deposit.
Some dads are cool like that. My mom is that way sometimes.
I was shocked. I was fully prepared to pay the full thing. He's great.
I just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything
my bus broke down and i was late for work_comma_ again!
Are you a busdriver?
no i ride a bus to work. this has happened twice in the past month. i need to get a car
Ah_comma_ gotcha. I hate it when things happen out of our control. Hope you get it figured out
Hey there
Hi what you got going on?
Uhm.. just feeling blue. My gf broke up with me recently and got married to an investment banker
That is really sad.  Are you alright?
i guess so.. i mean_comma_ we were the same age. This guy was like 5-6 years elder_comma_ so ahead of me in life. i tried convincing her to give me a bit more time.. well.
I feel so bad that i failed my last semester exam
I'm sorry.  Will you be able to pass this semester/
I am doing my best to pass
I'm sure it will happen.
i will be presenting my project to the company and am tensed about it
I am sure you will do well!
Yes_comma_ i have prepared for two months now
I don't think you will need to worry then.
My best friend had arranged for my birthday party_comma_ but she did not attend_comma_ i feel so bad
Sorry to hear that. Why did they not attend?
he was at work
Hopefully your friend can make it up to you and hang out with you some time soon.
my parents went on vacation and i am left aloe in the house
Ha_comma_ hope you aren't too scarred about being all by yourself.
i am scared_comma_ especially at night
Watching too many horror movies I bet. Just put on some comedy special.
Man I am so glad I was able to climb out of poverty.
That's quite an accomplishment. You must have worked very hard.
I was homeless for about a year.  It felt like every day I would just descened even further.  But I always held out hope that things would get better.
That must have been a very hard time. Your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope.
Well there was a little luck in there as well.  I certainly feel a little blssed by my current situation.
I'm so pleased with myself right now.  I saved up enough money to make all of my car payments at once next month.
That's very good. It takes a disciplined person to save money
Heh_comma_ well I didn't exactly save money that mush.  I just hunkered down and started working harder and asked for more hours.
You truely are determined to get that car_comma_ what brand is it?
It's a Kia Soul.  I hope to trade it in someday to cover the down payment on an electric car.
i am confident i am going to pass my exam
I hope you pass your exam. Did you do good at your exam?
yes_comma_ i always read hard
Good luck
Man I had an absolute blast from the past last week.
Really? What happened?
I found my old elementary school.  I hear it was going to be torn down next month_comma_ so I toured the inside.
Wow_comma_ cool! Did they let you in? It's so cool you had that opportunity.
Yeah.  It was mostly abandoned anyway.  Memeories filled my head anyway and I found myself in the past again.
Yeah I went to a used car lot yesterday to check out a car I saw on the internet.  Not happy.
Ick. I've never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that.
Well I realzied that the owner had taken the pictures of the car from a large distance.  Up close it was very disappointing.
Ah_comma_ I see. The classic photo trick. I understand why you would be upset about that. That's definitly why it's so important to go see before you buy
Well I know I won't be buying anything from that place!
hi
Hi_comma_ tell me what's going on with you?
not going.hoe are u?
Oh_comma_ I'm well thank you.
its ok ya
Man I am so cheesed off today!
Oh really? Any reason why?
Yeah I was buying something in electronics and this guy shows up out of nowhere and starts criticizing my purchase!
Wow really? That's pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing.
That's the thing!  It wasn't an employee_comma_ it was another customer!
You'll never guess what I saw on the road today.
Do tell
I saw a bear crossing the road a mile from my job.
That's neat! I've only seen ducks and chickens. A deer did bounce over my car once_comma_ though
Yet it really shocked me.  But he just ran off_comma_ so not much excitement.
Man I was so stoked to check my bank account today
I guess it didn't turn out well?
No man it was GREAT.  I finally got my first paycheck after my rasie!
oh.  SWEET!  Congrats!  What are you going to do with all that money??
Well I was gonna buy a few video games_comma_ but I'll of course set some aside.  No need to go crazy.
Save it for Spider-Man that comes out next month!  I can't wait for that
Thinking about it!  But  I may not have to_comma_ as by then I'll get another paycheck at this pay grade!
And more to come hopefully!  Don't forget to save for retirement and/or emergency fund :D
hi
Hello
how are you?
Am doing well thanks and you?
fine ya.thank you
hi
hi
how are you?
fine. But_comma_ I think you're suppose to do the prompts_comma_ so hope it doesn't cause you a rejection.
not for the rejections
hi
What have your experiences been like?
so nice my experience.
That's good to hear! Hope that it continues that way.
yes
I feel angry i have to pay with an interest
Oh I hate that. Is it a high interest rate?
yes_comma_ it is exorbitant just to say
It's highway robbery. Well I can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible.
One of my friends sent me a lot of money for my birthday right when I needed it a lot.
You read
I do read a lot of articles.
That's great _comma_ sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable
Yes_comma_ he's one of my best friends and I really appreciated the help.  He's like a brother to me.  And it's okay about the error.
There was one time when I was in grade school and the fire alarm went off when I was in the bathroom.  I had a hard time buttoning my pants up and had to walk out holding them together in front of my classmates.
Oh my god_comma_ that must have been so embarrasing! Was there actually a fire?
Nope_comma_ it turned out to be a fire drill.  Everyone was laughing at me.  It wasn't one of my prouder moments.
Its okay_comma_ at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment.
I am sitting here and guessing when will the wi-fi stop working.
Oh no_comma_ I hate having connectivity problems! Are you having bad weather?
Yep its raining cats and dogs in here.
Oh_comma_ it has been raining here a lot too. I will keep my fingers crossed that your wi-fi keeps working!
Is anyone here?
Yes_comma_ I am here
Yes_comma_ I had fully charged it and after like 6-7 rides it had 3% left.
Oh no_comma_ I bet that was stressful. What did you do?
Well_comma_ I called the very last customer and made sure he only was traveling like 5-6 miles and that the system wouldn't die. It worked out.
Recently I've been enjoying being by myself.
I like my alone time too. What do you enjoy doing by yourself?
I just love people watch_comma_ if that's considered alone time.
Oh that's is fun. It's a way to be alone with your thoughts_comma_ but still be around others. I love to watch people!
When I wake up and know that I am doing the things that I like_comma_ I feel great.
Yes I can related to that feeling
I don't think people realize iportance of that in their life.
Well_comma_ a great morning leads to a great day
i watched a horror movie and i feel terrified and anxious all the time
Which movie did you watch?
lost
That is a very scary movie! How are you coping?
It was really hurtful
What was hurtful may I ask?
Well_comma_ they made me leave everything at my desk_comma_ walked me downstairs_comma_ turn in my badge_comma_ and would mail my belonings.
That sounds like very bad treatment_comma_ You should sue them
Yah_comma_ I feel like it. Thanks for understanding.
I feel very strange for not feeling any remorse about anything really.
Maybe you haven't done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorseful about. Do you think that's it?
I think it might just be a stage in life.
Maybe. It's none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way_comma_ they could be experiencing depression.
Is it terribleto always feel ok_comma_ and not wait for the bad times
I suppose it is.
Than I will go on feeling this way I guess_comma_ or do I have another option?
You always have options!
She was actually always blind-sinding nice to my face and back-stabbing the other.
Sounds like someone who is actually not a friend. How long have you known her?
I have known her less than a year.
I used to work with a girl like that. She always talked bad about me but was nice to my face.
Yah_comma_ I can't stand when that happens. Just so wrong.
Do you ever feel that now you have finally grasped what life really is..
I can't say that I really do. It's always a mystery in my mind.
Or is the sign of overconfidence_comma_ like they say_comma_ -  there are two types of bikes_comma_ those that were in an accident_comma_ and those that will be?
I believe I see it more as that type. No one can truly know.
Some markets have to be avoided_comma_ that is if you valued your sense of smell.
I know what you mean. Wednesdays there's this market I like to go to_comma_ but lately it just has so much rotten food
Yet there's still something about that imperfection_comma_ do you agree?
Totally. I still love to go have a look around
Don't you think that the only one really capable of bringing you down_comma_ is you?
Yes_comma_ it is partially true. What is the problem?
There aren't any_comma_ I am just drawing a conclusion from past experience.
I understand.
Sometime all it take is one rude person to ruin your day.
That is very true. Did something bad happen to you?
Nothing major_comma_ but I am still learning how to deal with such behavior and always open for an advice.
Generally just try to ignore it as best as you can. I'm good about just letting things roll off my back.
when i went for shopping i parked my car at a no parking zone which i am not aware _comma_ police approached the car and was about to tow it away
Oh no! Those can be difficult to spot sometimes.
yes exactly _comma_ but i also had my 4 6 month old 11 month old baby with me .
Wow. That must have been stressful. I have babies_comma_ too. Did they understand?
ya after they had seen my 11 month old baby with me they felt they should not trouble me by towing away car . i felt very thankful to them
That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.
yes some people are very understanding and helpful
gosh ive been feeling so nervous for the past 24 hours_comma_ its almost like an impending sense of doom_comma_ To my knowledge theres nothing about to go wrong or blow up in my face but it feels like something is going badly
I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.
i ordered some semi expensive tablet yesterday so maybe its that but like_comma_ i cant think of a logical reason why that would go wrong so im left wondering why i feel so nervous_comma_ its really weird_comma_ very hard to relax like this
Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt it's anything you did.
I've been recently thinking about the things we don't appreciate.
I think it's very common that we take things for granted.
Is there anything that can change that?
I think you can really think about all that you have_comma_ and show your thanks that you have these things.
Yah_comma_ was depressing.
What was depressing?
Well_comma_ just really did a lot of housework and felt we lost contact.
Oh_comma_ that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?
Yes_comma_ it got so much better the next few days.
have you ever watched this show it was really quite good?
What is the name of the show?
It was called Hero's
No_comma_ I ever did.
it was actually quite good
I am currently waiting to receive my security deposit back from my old apartment.
why hasnt it already been returned?
They said it takes up to 30 days_comma_ and it's only been a few weeks.
if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner_comma_ i hear you can go to small claims and get 3x the amount awarded to you
Wow_comma_ that's good to know.
yeah r/legaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me_comma_ Pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you
I ordered a surface pro yesterday! its gonna be so cool to play around with when it arrives
That's cool. I've always been a Mac kind of girl_comma_ but I would look into a Surface is I was in the market for a new computer.
i only ever wanted one cause they can do the same stuff a regular computer can but also touch screen so you can draw on it_comma_ i always got discouraged drawing on paper cause id waste so much of it_comma_ and then just stop
I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago_comma_ but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better.
It was such a sweet moment.
what was ?
Spending time watching TV and sipping wine together.
oh that does sound nice
Do you like wine?
As the day was coming to an end_comma_ I was begging to believe that my solitude was perfect.
Well in some ways solitude is nice.
Yes if you take it in portions.
True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring.
But I needed to be responsible.
Be responsible about what?
Well_comma_ about getting daily chorses done--work first-- play later.
I understand. I have to get work around my house done today too_comma_ before I can go out.
Yes_comma_ it teaches us self-pride.
I got backed into last week by another car.
Oh no_comma_ sorry to hear_comma_ hope you are OK.
I'm fine_comma_ but they left a nasty dent in the front of my car. Now I have to get it fixed_comma_ which is a hassle.
I agree. Hope the car will look good again.
Meh i kinda feel bad_comma_ i wish i had family members to talk to
Sorry to hear that. Did you try to talk to a friend?
friends are cool but its not quite the same as a family member_comma_ a spouse would be but i dont have that either!
I understand
Yah_comma_ two colored socks is crazy.
I agree_comma_ where did you find them?
LOL_comma_ mixed up in my drawer.
Oh I see_comma_ Ha! I would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!
Yes_comma_ funny.
when i was travelling alone in a car at night in ghat road suddenly some boulders fell on the road
Was it an accident?
no the boulders fell 50 meters infront of me _comma_ luckily i was going slow and suddenly stopped
Oh ! Thank good ness! That was close
yes but i am so much worried for what happened that night
I ate so many macadamia nuts today_comma_ I don't know how to feel about it.
do you especially enjoy macadamia nuts or just eating?
It the only nut that I can eat_comma_ that's why I can't help overeating.
It must be difficult living with a nut allergy. Do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?
its sooooooo hot outside_comma_ 30c. its borderline impossible to deal with
It's awful out there. It's been in the 100's here in TX
oh no_comma_ texas is basically in a desert isnt it. for me on top of heat i also get some 3 wasps a day flying into my apartament and looking around_comma_ i just got one earlier and had to kill it to get rid of it. very annoying_comma_ apparently wasps love it though
That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs_comma_ so I feel your annoyance.
spiders are really the worst_comma_ thankfully it looks like the heat was useful for Something at least and killed them off
I start back at work in a couple of weeks.
what job did you apply to?
I'm a teacher_comma_ so I've been off this summer. I am looking forward to having 12th graders again this year.
Somehow i suspect that theyre not looking forward to having you though :P (no offence) i cant remember anyone that enjoyed high school lol. Its a good job though! literally backbone of society
Haha_comma_ true. I try to make it a little more enjoyable for them_comma_ but I've also been in their shoes.
I always trust my family like my mom to give me good advice.
Yeah that's always comforting.  Mom's are awesome
Do you ever disagree with your Mom?
Not really.  We usually tend to think alike.  Why do you ask?
Aww_comma_ I didn't really relate until I had children of my own
Cool.  So you're the awesome mother here?
We both are.
i was really pissed off when i found out my best friend slept with my girlfriend. i was shaking all over!
I'm sorry to hear that
yeah well. what you gonna do.. thats life..
:( did you stay friends with him?
hell no.. i could never look at him again
i had recently applied for graduate masters in very prestigious universities but initially i was worried whether i get admission or not
did you get admission?
yeah i thought the competition was tough and i may not get admitted_comma_ but luckily i was admitted
That's great news_comma_ well done.
yes i am totally relived of that stress now
:)
I hate when I am tired.
Me too_comma_ especially when it's still the middle of the day.
or in the case here_comma_ morning
Oh yes_comma_ you're right. I'm in the same boat right now!
I just need six good hours of sleep
i ate 3 pizzas just earlier and i feel so good and relaxed now_comma_ almost tranquility
I think I am missing something_comma_ you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizzas???
yeah i know right_comma_ a lot_comma_ and i am pretty thin so i shouldnt feel ok_comma_ But i totally do feel great .
It's definitely some kind of anomaly.
i think you just dont appreciate how good pizza is
Sometime ago I was really hungry and decided to treat myself to some well reviewed restaurant_comma_ well it was all I hoped for.
What did you eat there?
Onion soup with croutons.
ooooh onion soup sounds really good_comma_ onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish
i was extremely disgusted when a close friend of mine threw up on my baby. he was really drunk at a party we were at
I would have flipped and never talked to him again. I am so sorry my god what did you do?
what else can i do? i washed my kid clean and got the hell out of there
Idk beat him up_comma_ lol. throw a drink at him_comma_ the sky is the limit!
I just finished making my bulletin board at work.
cool_comma_ how did it come by?
I'm happy with it. Hopefully my students like it too.
if you put so much work into it_comma_ im sure they will
i was so angry when i found out that my girlfriend cheated on me.. dont know how i can forgive her
I am so sorry! I would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust. How long have you been together?
3 years
Wow. I hope that you can work it out_comma_ but I would understand why you wouldn't want to.
I really feel nostalgic around christmas
really? well_comma_ who doesnt!
true.. there is something about that holiday that makes us wanna be kids again
i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas
my dad gave me the greatest gift ever on my graduation
wow_comma_ what was it?
a brand new ford car_comma_ i was thrilled
woohoo! you are one lucky child!
i felt really good about my change to new york after getting a job
No way! I just moved from NY to FL. You are going to love NY tho_comma_ its an awesome state. Congrats on the job!
thank you so much.. i moved from Idaho.. so this is very new to me_comma_ all this
Oh yeah sounds like its super new to you especially if you are in the city. I was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like Idaho where I lived in NY. :p
i felt heartbroken when my girlfriend moved away without telling me first
I would too why would she not tell you!? Did yall break up?
we had a fight_comma_ i never knew we were broken up though
That sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved. :/
hi there it was a hard day when this incident occured.
What incident was that ?
i was driving home and it started to rain
what happened then ?
my tire went out and was going to call fro help. I didn't get a chance to call.
my dad passed away around the time of christmas.. it always casts a shadow over my holidays
I know what you mean_comma_ it sucks when those "dates" linger over us even if we try not to think about them. Im so sorry to hear that!
yeah.. i know it is time to get over it. but certain memories are so haunting
Its not time to get over it_comma_ you arent doing any wrong its okay to "feel" things. I hope people around you give you a lot of love!
i feel like my dog is my child time after another.. love him so much
i understand what you are saying_comma_ pets are always close to our hearts
very true_comma_ do you have any pets?
yeah_comma_ i have 2 german shepards
i was shaking when i was watching conjuring in the movies
is it a scary movie?
it is a terrifying movie. havent you seen it yet?
no i never heard of it
yesterday i was so angry at my parents.. but i kept my mouth shut and came away. i cant hurt them_comma_ i feel so faithful
yea thats probably the best choice to make
i always think all those hard times they had bringing me up
i can understand that
some guy threw up on the street last night right before me.. i was grossed out
Yuck_comma_ that is terrible. I would be grossed out too. What did you do?
i got the hell out of there right away!
I'm sure you did. Guess he couldn't make it to the trash can.
I saw some pictures recently of when my family and I went on vacation when I was little.
oh thats really sweet!
Yeah_comma_ it made me sad to see it because they I live so far away now.
oh no.. i hope you feel better
i love thinking about fond memories with my family
Those are great aren'
do you have a large family?
Sorry(Those are great aren't they?) I do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years. Those memories are to be cherished and repeated :)
My roommate recently moved out of my house so now it is just me and my dog.  My dog is really nice and doesn't really bark unless he sees a stranger coming up to the house.  Lately he has been sitting at the top of the steps to the basement and growls/barks.  However_comma_ there are no windows to the basement and he wouldnt be able to see into the basement.  I have no idea why he has been barking at that door lately.
wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle
I'm not bothered by him barking.  As someone who watches a lot of scary movies it is more of a worry factor that someone is down there than anything.
i can understand that
I got a job offer at another company that pays more_comma_ but I turned them down because I've been with my current company for ten years.
Do you think it was the right decision?
Definitely_comma_ my company always treat's me right. They haven't gave me a reason to want to leave.
That's great. Maybe you will get a raise too
i felt shy when i dropped my groceries in the parking lot
why is that
because there were soda cans rolling all around the parking lot and i was scrambling to pick them all up
oh i can understand that
The other day an intruder broke into my home. I had to hide in the closet while I called the cops.
That must have been terrifying
It was_comma_ the whole time I was shaking and breathing heavily.
I don't know what I would have done
My dog Lola won first place in the dog show. That's my girl!
Awesome! What kind of dog is Lola?
She's a Pekingese. When they handed me the trophy I just couldn't stop smiling. She's the best dog I could ask for.
I don't think I would have been able to stop smiling either! That is so awesome!
i was happy this morning when i received an email from my grandma
That's nice_comma_ is she technologically savvy?
not really but she tries haha
Well it's nice she's making the effort!
i love reading old letters from family members
I do too. I have a box filled with them. How old is your oldest?
i have some old ones from the korean war
wow!
I have everything ready for back to school supplies for my son to start school.
That's good. Now you don't have to worry about it.
That is true! I also have his outfit picked out for the first day of school.
Wow_comma_ your son is lucky to have a parent who is on top of things!
I bet my cousin that I could beat him at a game of basketball. He's horrible at playing so I knew I could beat him.
What did you bet?
I bet him $1000 because that's how good I am. I had no doubt in my mind I could win. I ended up obliterating him and taking his shoes too.
That would be awesome! Did your cousin pay you?
i was sad to hear my mom is in the ER again
Oh no_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay.
me too_comma_ she has heart problems unfortunately
I am so sorry. I hope she is able to get some relief and rest.
thank you i appreciate the kind words
My son said his first word the other day. My little man is going to be smart just like his pop's.
Oh man! That must have been great to hear! What did he say?
He said poop. When I heard It I jumped up with joy. That's my boy!
That's so funny! That's one of those things you will definitely remember forever!
im envious of my friends who are at the park right now while im stuck inside
Oh I can understand that! I would also like to be outside; it looks like such a beautiful day! At least it is almost the weekend!
thats true_comma_ i'll be outside in an hour or less!
That's great! Are you going to join your friends at the park?
I was walking through a trail to get to my house last night and it was pitch black. I was afraid a bear or something might get me lol
You should have taken a flashlight just in case.
I was gonna use my phone but it died_comma_ so I just sprinted for like half an hour.
hey at least you got a nice workout in!
Yeah way to look at it positive lol. There was a river nearby so at least it sounded kind of relaxing.
That is true. Well I'm glad you made it home safely. Maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out.
For sure_comma_ or at least charge my phone haha. Thx I'm glad I didnt get mauled by a bear too
i felt sick after eating too much ice cream last night
I had ice cream too! Sorry you got sick
its my own fault i went past my limit lol
Ha_comma_ at least it was good
I took my pup to the park last weekend and he had fun meeting other dogs and their owners!
Thats always fun! Does your pup do well with other dogs?
Yeah he is a golden so he is happy no matter what lol. He will go up to people and not leave until they pet him.
Mine does the same thing. Goldens are so adorable.
Absolutely! What kind of dog do you have?
He is just a mix breed. We really don't even know.
Mixed breeds usually look really cool.
So I was drunk coming back from a party and woke up to find I peed the bed lol. First time in like 24 years.
lol_comma_ it happens to us all
Yea you cant help but feel like a stupid little kid or something_comma_ at least I did lol.
haha true
Got any crazy drinking stories?
i felt dumb when I lost my receipt
That sucks did you need to return something?
yes some printer ink
That stuff is pretty expensive. Maybe you can sell it on eBay or something.
So I was on the bus back from a party and a drunk guy barfed on me at a stop lol. Most of it got on my jacket and he didnt even apologize.
Oh wow! I would have been so disgusted and outraged! What did you do?
Well I didn't want to start a fight or anything_comma_ so I just took it off and held my nose the rest of the ride. Then I washed it like 6 times lol
That must have been a terrible experience. I'm not sure that I would be able to wear that jacket again.
I wouldnt have but it was a pretty expensive northface I had for many years.
I can't wait for college in the fall! I left 2 years ago and am back feeling more confident in my studying abilities.
i hope you do really well
Thanks anything youre looking forward to?
going to see some old friends this weekend
Cool when was the last time you saw them?
i was happy with myself for working hard this week
Good job what did you work hard on?
my job and at the gym
Nice keep it up!
I got back into college after 2 years off and I'm pretty proud of myself.
That is awesome!  What are you studying
Ya thanks it's mechanical engineering I have 2 years left.
was it hard to go back or are you enjoying it?
Oh I am going back in a few weeks. It will probably be hard but I will enjoy it for sure.
Well good luck!  I am sure you will do great!
Thank you! I sure hope so.
So last weekend it poured rain all day and I chilled at my house by myself. Pretty boring.
I do like the rain though
It is relaxing_comma_ the only thing is that you can't do anything outside really. Had some plans but they got canceled.
I am sure you will have plans again
That's true_comma_ it's good to look forward to the future.
Yeah_comma_ I am sure it will be fine
Yeah did you do anything exciting last weeked?
I saw a dude driving a Porsche down the street of my city. Was definitely jealous lol
I would have been to. I always wonder how people make the money necessary to buy vehicles like that.
Yeah I am thinking this guy must be a CEO or something. If I had the money I would buy one for sure.
Same here. I saw a Ferrari at the supermarket the other day. I was jealous_comma_ and I also thought about how I would be worried something would happen to it (if it were mine).
Yeah I guess if something happened you are probably rich enough to just buy another lol.
Yesterday_comma_ I ate a whole pizza by myself!
I take you don't have issued with you weight.
No_comma_ I just did it because nobody thought I could.
Ok_comma_ then.If it was a 1 thing only_comma_ no problem.
This guy at school keeps following me around. He followed me all day yesterday. I think he want's to be my friend.
Is he acting creepy at all?
It's getting to that point. I wish he would just stop. I have enough friends already.
Have you tried to talk to him at all and see what his deal is?
Im proud of my dogs behaing around new visitors
That's good you have well-behaved dogs_comma_ did you train them?
Not on purpose_comma_ but they have learned from right and wrong from me
Well it's good you're doing something right.
Do you have pets
The other day I went on a airplane and had a panic attack the whole time. I'm not good with heights.
Oh no! What did you do to bring yourself down? (from the panic attack)
I had to cover my head with a blanket_comma_ and picture myself somewhere else. That's how bad it was.
I'm sorry. That sounds bad. Flying always makes me nervous but I usually make it ok.
I don't have a lot of friends.
Well we are friends aren't we? I do appreciate you as one.
Thanks. In my mom's group_comma_ I feel like a lot of the moms are friends but I'm not friends with any of them.
You wanna maybe go to the bar with my other friends this weekend? They will probably like you. Tim likes some things you do.
That sounds nice_comma_ I just need to connect with someone.
I was in a small fender bender earlier this week. Now I am scared that I will be in an even worse wreck.
Oh i hate it when i get those kind of thoughts but eventually you recover and don't think about it.
I hope so. I am driving and I just get so scared.
Just relax more you got this and it was just a fender bender.
I took my son out and did a bunch of nice stuff for him.  He was great until we got to naptime.
Naptime is a good thing though isnt it
It is but he threw a huge temper tantrum at naptime.
Well that is never good
For mother's day_comma_ my son had to fill out a paper in school that asked a bunch of questions.
That doesnt sound too fun
I read it when he got home and alot of his responses involved mommy said a bad word!
Oh wow_comma_ the kid is a snitch
i was upset i woke up so late today
It happens_comma_ everyone does it
yeah thats true_comma_ not the end of the world;
I am sure you will fix it
i am annoyed at my neighbor's loud lawnmower
Have you spoken to him about it?
nope its happening right now
Are you going to do anything about it in the future?
I was able to find a new job after being fired
congratulations im glad_comma_ hopefully you will like it more than your last job
It turned out to be better than my last one for the most part
im glad to hear that
I went to a restaurant and ordered some pizza
what kind of pizza?
Bacon and sausage pizza.  Unfortunately_comma_ it also had a cockroach crawling across it when I picked it up
what!! i hope u got your money back
i was nervous about my car overheating
Why's that?
it was over 100 degrees outside and i was low on antifreeze
Did your car end up overheating?
A supervisor I didn't like got fired
Thats great! But what did they do that you didn't like?
He and I never got along_comma_ seemed like he tried to sabotage me
Well looks like that didn't work out for him in the end. What finally got him axed?
i felt upset about losing my friend's blu ray i borrowed
Did you replace it?
not yet im still looking for it
Do you think he'll get angry?
I was walking down the sidewalk at night and thought I saw someone following me
did you start walking faster?
Yeah_comma_ tried to get out of there
hopefully you made it out safely
My neighbors really look out for each other
That is good to hear. What happened that made you think so?
They always holding hands and smiling
Oh ok. That sounds like they really get along well. It is nice to have good neighbors.
Yes it is _comma_ so far
i was worried when I heard my friend was in the hospital
Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope it was nothing serious!
no he has already been released thankfully
That's good to know!  You all have a lot to be thankful for!
I loaned my neighbor some money. Hopefully he pays it back today
I would hope so too or else the relationship would be awkward.
Yes thats true_comma_ to say the least
I hope it wasn't too much money just in case.
Around 30_comma_ but ive know him a while
im getting stoked for the weekend
What you you have planned?
nothing! thats why im excited lol
Really?? It sounds like there was something going on.
I cleaned the refridgerator out the other day and I found something that had gone very very bad.
Oh that's never a good situation. It happens to the best of us though. I need to clean my fridge
I put it off too long this time. It was pretty stinky_comma_ my dogs thought I was nuts for throwing food away.
I'm sure they were thinking waste not_comma_ want not. haha
I was reading through some old school papers
Oh yeah? Find anything interesting?
It made me think about how far I've come since.  I also felt like I was in a different time and place reading them
Ah_comma_ nothing quite like that feeling. I remember when I was on the school newspaper. Good times.
My friends went out to a party
Are you going_comma_ too?
They didn't invite me for some reason
Oh no_comma_ that sucks. Would you have wanted to go though?
My roommate left a bunch of dishes in the kitchen
Well_comma_ that's not cool.
I wish he'd pick up after himself
Does he do that stuff often?
I was busy with a work related project
Oh? What kind of project?
Presentation_comma_ a co-worker came in and helped me out
Oh that's nice of them!
I put in extra hours at work
That's good_comma_ do you get paid over time?
Yeah_comma_ I would like for my boss to notice and promote me at some point
I think if you keep it up you'll get the recognition you want soon.
I was taking a stroll at night and saw a group of guys up ahead
Was everything okay? What were they doing?
I ended up turning around_comma_ who knows what they were up to
True_comma_ you never know these days.
I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet
Is your phone waterproof?
My case was_comma_ as the phone still worked
You are so lucky! My phone would have been done...
I've been consistently working out the past few weeks
That's great! Are you seeing results?
Absolutely_comma_ I feel so much better too
I bought a spin bike but I haven't used it yet
I took some cookies my roommate left out in the open
Maybe they were left for you.
I think he meant to save them
He can't save them out in the open. What kind were they?
A friend forgot his phone at the library
Did he get it back? I hate it when that happens...
I went back and grabbed it for him
You are a true friend indeed. I bet he is very appreciative!
A friend of mine was having a hard time finding a job
Did he eventually find one?
After months of work_comma_ he at least got an interview
That is making progress.
I recently graduated college_comma_ I'm so glad I finally got it done!
Congratulations!  What do you plan on doing?
Next stop is hopefully pharmacy school. Okay_comma_ maybe not completely done.
That is a great goal to set for yourself.
Thank you. I'm really excited!
I recently spent a couple of restless days awaiting the results of a skin biopsy.  I had a weird mole come up out of nowhere.
I am sorry to hear that. I hope the results will be good.
I got them back yesterday_comma_ and it was good news.  No cancer!
It is good new.
Yes_comma_ it was really good news.  I have a profound sense of relief.
Awhile back_comma_ our whole household was awoken by someone kicking hard at our front door.
Was it an intruder?
No_comma_ it was my drunk cousin_comma_ lol.  She had tried knocking and we didn't hear her.
What a surprise haha
Yes_comma_ it was a bit scary at first_comma_ but then funny.

Well I stayed up late too. Drinking beer and playing vidos games lol
I got hired for my dream job at apple! I can't wait to start!
Holy goodness! That's so cool. What will you do there?
I will help design the new iphones. It's going to be so much fun!
Oh my god! That's something to be proud of_comma_ congrats!
Yesterday was my day off and I spent the whole day in bed looking at the ceiling. My friends and family didn't even call or check up on me.
I am sorry you are feeling like this.  Maybe you should reach out to someone
It's like they only call me when they need something. The only friend I have is myself.
I am sorry that you are going through this
The other day I got on a roller coaster for the first time_comma_ and I almost pooped my pants because we were so high up.
Oh wow_comma_ now that's funny! I've only been on one roller coaster and it was rather small_comma_ but I loved it!
This roller coaster was one of the biggest in the world and i'm not good with heights.
Oh wow! I'd love to go on a much larger coaster than the one I road. But it might be scarier than I imagine.
i couldnt believe how good my nephew is at little league
How old is he?
8!
They are still cute at this age and they make a lot of progress.
The other day I was on a date with a beautiful women and I accidentally spilled wine on her dress.
Oh no! Well hopefully she wasn't too upset_comma_ then you'll know how her character is :)
She hasn't returned any of my calls. I feel horrible.
Oh no! Well_comma_ honestly if she can't deal with one mistake_comma_ then it's no good anyhow. But maybe it was something else. Sometimes people just don't click.
Yesterday was my first time at a karaoke bar. I started to get all tense when my friends kept telling my I should go on stage to perform.
I feel you! I don't like to perform in front of people either. Did you decline?
No_comma_ I ended up going through with it. I was worried that they would boo me at first because my singing is horrible_comma_ but I guess everyone was too drunk to care.
Oh you can be as bad as you want there_comma_ it just matters if you're having fun :)
I finally purchased the house of my dreams. We barley finished moving in yesterday.
Wow _comma_ i bet it was a long day of moving_comma_ but i can imagine the joy you must feel inside you_comma_ congratulations !!!!
Thanks. I did it all by myself too. All that saving finally paid off!
I used to move furniture for my old job_comma_ so i bet it was a lot of heavy lifting_comma_ its so exciting to finally have your own place

You can make new friends. Its just part of the human experience. Everything is temporary
i recently lost my dog_comma_ he died.  i had him for 12 years.
Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that!

What have they been doing?
just generally driving poorly and not using signals
Do you honk at them?
i saw a guy lift a car_comma_ he was so strong

i was shocked by how many people showed up to protest
What is the protest for?
free speech
What happened? Why were they being limited?
i found a spider in my bathtub
They do love to surprise ya_comma_ don't they?

Interesting. I didn't know that. So did you end up taking it outside?
i just moved it out of the bathtub. i relocated him temporarily
i used to take my children to disney world when they were young_comma_ we always had a great time.

They grow up so fast sometimes.

i was fired from my job.
I'm so sorry to hear that!
i was crushed_comma_ didn't even see it coming.
Did they say why?

sometimes i wish i could go back to being a teenager
Why do you say that?

Yea_comma_ I totally get ya on that.
everything was just easier
sometimes i just wish i could be a hermit and never deal with people
Man_comma_ are you me? People been annoying lately?
Yes!! Try to walk through walmart_comma_ people are so rude!
Here I was hoping a Walmart would open in my area. Guess it's a good thing there isn't one.

Oh which Disney? Sounds exciting!
disney world! this will be my 6th time.
What's your favorite thing to do there?
Epcot! I love visiting the different nations.
some one ran into my car and drove off
That would make me so mad!  What did you do?
i called the police and my insurance company.  people just have no respect.
Yeah_comma_ It bothers me when people don't take responsibility for their actions.
they were probably on heroine or something
Went on a first date last night. I had chocolate from the appetizer in my beard the entire time.
Lol. Why didn't she tell you?
I don't know. She was strange. I did not notice until I went to the restroom right before I left.
So you're not gonna see her again?
She text me today but I'm not interested. She was beautiful but not very smart at all.
Gotta have brains
It's been over a year since my last cup of coffee. Today was the day I taste the sweet juice of the god's again.
Why did you stop?
To show my self I had self control. I was drinking like 5 cups a day.

Today as soon as my lips touched the cup. I felt my soul smile.
I bet. I get that feeling every morning with a Dr Pepper

I never thought I could love someone as much as my little baby girl.
I know! It's almost an unexplainable feeling isn't it?
Yes_comma_ It is so hard to describe honestly!
But it is also the best feeling ever! Enjoy every moment!
Thank you! It is hard at times tho when getting little sleep.
Best advice I ever got was that housework can wait and take naps whenever you cam when the baby sleeps!
Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing!
What did you almost buy?
I saw this great used car in a print ad_comma_ and went to the dealership_comma_ but when I got there_comma_ it was all ratty and crappy looking!
Ah_comma_ yea_comma_ I've had the once or twice. When you buy used you have to go in with the mindset of haggle down_comma_ find a decent one_comma_ or leave
The guy used an old picture of the car to fool me!  What a jerk!
For some reason heavy rain at night brings up some good memories for me.
I love heavy rain_comma_ it just really soothes me.
Yes_comma_ the sound that it makes when the windows are open...
I know! Also the thunder is so cool to listen to.
I wasn't feeling right a few days ago_comma_ but I guess I'm alright now.
I did a research on a cancer vaccine
Well I meant my mood_comma_ not my health in general.
Oh sorry for the mix up
As I was people watching today I suddenly felt very happy.
What happened to you?
That's a thing_comma_ nothing really_comma_ I guess I just relaxed for a bit.
OK. I hope you are now fine?
Have you ever wish to switch places with your cat for a day or two?
Never. I hate cats personally
How about_comma_ dogs?
I've come to hate them too unfortunately. Constant noise
After the earthquake  I visited the old capitol_comma_ and saw still intact temples.
Oh_comma_ that's so sad. What earthquake?
It was a 8.6 I believe_comma_ but it happened like 2 years ago.
Oh_comma_ that's a big one. I bet it caused a lot of damage
I watched a stray dog yesterday that had a lot of tick_comma_ I felt bad for her.
Aw that's so sad! Did you help it?
I didn't_comma_ I don't know why_comma_ maybe because I hate ticks.
I guess that's fair_comma_ but I probably would've taken it to the vet.
For some reason I never liked cloudy weather.
Me neither. It's why I hate living in London
Oh I don't know how you guys do it_comma_ you must have artificial sun at home?
Nope. We just remain miserable year round
I was listening to a guitar play the other day_comma_ and it made me cry a little.
Music can be so touching to the soul.
Yes_comma_ especially when you don't expect it to be.
Who was the artist of the song?
I had to get some incense few days ago_comma_ because my room smelled bad.
I like incense. Did you find the cause of the bad odor?
Yes_comma_ it some plumbing problems.
Oh well I hope you can fix it soon
I realized a while ago_comma_ that it is good if you are not afraid of fear.
What made you realize that? You can't live in fear
Yes_comma_ but if you don't run away from it_comma_ there wont be any fear.
It's good to face your fears
I had some thought come into my mind_comma_ and they turned me red.
Oh was it a bad or naughty thought?
It was a crazy though actually_comma_ but thank god I didn't act on it.
What was it? Was it really that crazy?
We grew up fighting a lot with my sibling_comma_ but I still love them.
I think that happen in a lot of families.
Yes_comma_ you are right_comma_ but we still need to forgive.
I understand. You were the only one getting hit?

i totally agree with that
My granny walked in on me and my girlfriend the other day
oh nice
It was really awkward though.. i mean_comma_what do you do at that moment!
wait til she leaves and continue
I often am gone from my home and family for days or even weeks at a time.  I work on remote locations_comma_ looking for oil and gas.
Sounds like an interesting job.  I'm sure it's taxing on the family though.
It is difficult feeling isolated.  I miss them a lot.
In the end is the trade off worth it?
I don't really know_comma_ to be honest.  It pays our bills_comma_ and it is fun work_comma_ but it is hard.
I saw robert downey jr the other day.. such an awesome experience
I am so jealous. He is one of my all time favorite actors.
He is so charming and electrifying in person as well.. such a nice guy
Were you star struck?
So get this_comma_ my friend once threw up on me after getting drunk

I would have done the same as well
My phone company was billing me for stuff i did not use
Oh no.. I'm sure you did not feel great when you found out
I was extremely irritated actually
I would be too. Hopefully that gets resolved soon
I felt really good about myself when i stepped in for my interview last week

This is such an awesome coincidence buddy
I was so afraid when i was watching the new conjuring movie

A few weeks ago I got in my first real car accident.
I am sorry to hear that.  You weren't hurt were you?

I was so grossed out when a friend threw up on me

Yeah I'd imagine.  The months off for summer is nice though.
I gave my credit card for a stranger to use once
Why would you do that?
I felt sorry for the person_comma_ she looked trustworthy. and she needed to pay for some medicines for a friend who had accident
So_comma_ why didn't you just pay for them your self?

There is something so nice about being prepared fully
Agreed.  No sense wasting time while cooking by looking for odds and ends.

Horrible_comma_ my palms were sweaty the entire time. I hate talking in front of large crowds.
Me_comma_ too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now_comma_ right?
My friend got accepted into Harvard University. That's my dream school. I don't understand how someone as dumb as him can get accepted there_comma_ and i'm stuck at community college.
Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.
That's what i'm thinking_comma_ it's not what you know it's who you know.
Yep_comma_ that's the way of the world_comma_ especially with Universities to.
i recently ordered earphones online but i receive duplicate product
A duplicate? Like a fake?
yes i received a fake product _comma_ the make of earphones is very well known brand
That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.
yes that s true _comma_ i regularly buy online but this is the first time i experienced this.
I had the worst day ever yesterday.  I had just finished a long_comma_ hard day at work_comma_ I had driven the 40 minutes home_comma_ was just driving into my street and realised that I had left my bag with phone_comma_ purse and most importantly my house keys back in the office!
Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?
Well I wanted to cry and scream_comma_ I was so cross with myself but unfortunately as I live alone I just had to drive the 40 minutes back to the office to get them then another 40mins back home.  Where i swiftly had a little glass of wine to help lol.
Ah yes_comma_ a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still_comma_ what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day.
Exactly_comma_ so irritating.  But hey you live and learn_comma_ I guarantee you I will never leave work again without double then triple checking that I have all my belongings with me!
I would be so lost without my phone_comma_ but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though!
I was shocked to see $200.00 included with the card.
Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?
No not at all_comma_ She justed wanted to make sure I had a good birthday.
So_comma_ it was your partner who used you card
one month back i went for a wildlife safari _comma_ where i was attacked by a wild boar
Oh no! Was anyone hurt?
ya i had bruises on my leg
That's pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?
it attacked me and ran into the bushes . it was a very bad experience.
Are you willing to go on another safari?
no i am done with such trips.
I'm not surprised.
My husbands brother was getting married.  I searched online and in every shop to find the perfect dress.  I finally found it_comma_ tried it on and loved it.  I couldnt buy it until the following week as I had to wait to payday so I left it over in the store.  The next day my sister in law called in.  She had been shopping and had also found the perfect dress.  She took it out of the bag to show me and I discovered it was the same dress!! Couldnt believe it.  Oh how I resented her at that moment.
That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.
Oh if envy could kill - she would have been dead on the spot.  Needless to say I got over it and found another dress but just at that moment on that day...
That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.
Indeed.  I had to take a reality check.  Afterall the day wasnt about me_comma_ it was about the bride and groom lol.
I never can get myself to give away their baby items.
You are telling me you are a hoarder?
lol no I just can't part with items that mean a lot to me like my kids baby things like first shirts ect.
Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine
I was walking down the street yesterday in my brand new summer dress.  I though i was gorgeous! Suddenly a big gust of wind came and blew my dress up around my ears! Where I succeeded in flashing my underwear to the entire street.  Oh the embarrassment.
Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red.
Oh my face was very red indeed and yes unfortunately I got a hugh cheer from a group of lads who witnessed it all.  I was so mortified I just ran home.  Later though I chatted about it with my friends and was finally able to laugh about it.
I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though
haha thats how I am trying to look at it.  Trying to see the funny side.  I have learnt my lesson about that dress though.  I think i will just put it back in the wardrobe and leave it there!
I so get how you feel because I decided to watch Insidious the other night on my own.  I scared the life out of myself afterwards because I thought I kept seeing shadows and hearing noises and had myself convinced someone or something was in the house with me!
That's crazy! I'm glad there was nothing there.
Oh no just my vivid imagination lol.  I do love a good horror but usually I watch them with my husband.  I am clearly not as brave on my own!!
Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.
You are right there.  Nothing better than a good film in general but horrors can really evoke such reactions from them.
I helped a doctor's assistant over a couple of months
That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.
It was she wasn't really good ans i had no problem helping
That's cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.
Yes!! They didn't forget me at Christmas
my car had a small accident recently
I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt.
no it was a minor accident _comma_ but car got damaged little
Do you have full cover?
yes _comma_ but when i went for claim insurance company terms made me feel helpless.
I never did find out why there were so many police cars there today.
Where did this happen?! Were there any other people with you?
In town_comma_ I had my kids with me to buy school supplies.
Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.
I found my old high school yearbooks that other day.
Oh that is pretty cool. What did you think?
I think that I didn't appreciate not having to worry about adult stuff back then!
Yeah_comma_ we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce.
It was. It was also crazy to see the 1980s hairstyles. So.much.hairspray.
I am feel pretty mucky things have been pretty stable at home.
That has got to feel good!  You must feel very happy and relaxed!
Yes I am and thankful since I have 3 young kids at home_comma_
Cherish this time you have_comma_ because you never know when it could change!
I got a gift card to a restaurant I've been wanting to try for a long time.
What restaurant is it for?
It's a local non-chain Greek restaurant. It's fancy and supposed to be very good.
Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.
Yes. Almost always better!
I went on a blind date last week. Honestly_comma_ I didn't know what to expect at first.
That sounds really interesting. Were there any good matches?
It was alright_comma_ but it was hard to find common ground at first.
Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.
I have a dentist appointment tomorrow. I think I have a cavity.
Oh no_comma_ I hate cavities. Are you brushing your teeth eVeryday?
Yes_comma_ but I think I'm genetically hosed when it comes to teeth. I really hate it.
Dang_comma_ that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that
My son scored a perfect 1600 on the SATs!!
Wow_comma_ you must be proud! He might cure cancer next!
I am proud. And he may eventually cure cancer_comma_ but I'd settle right now for him cleaning his room!
Geniuses don't do chores my friend.
I went to my moms funeral yesterday_comma_ but surprisingly I wasn't sad at all. I was at peace because she accomplished a lot during her time here on earth.
I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. It's good that you're at peace with it_comma_ though.
Yeah_comma_ she's in a better place now.
But a part of her is still here in you.
My husband and sons left town for weekend.
They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...
Yeah_comma_ it was cool for a while_comma_ but the house is way to quiet now
I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence
So_comma_ I bought myself a box strawberry frosted pop tarts last week. Today I went to go have one for breakfast...GONE!
Whoever ate it all is evil!!!
I need to interrogate everyone in this house. I'm so angry. You don't mess with Mom's Pop Tarts!
I know right. I would be so furious!
My neighbor was having a party last night and wouldn't let me sleep. I felt like going out there and giving him a piece of my mind!
I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.
No_comma_ next time I might snap. They never show any consideration for anybody on the block. They do whatever they want.
Yeah_comma_ something should be done about it!
My friend wanted to go to lunch today. I told her I was busy_comma_ but really I just didn't want to go...
I've done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Don't feel bad!
Well_comma_ I do feel a little guilty_comma_ just sitting here on my couch watching tv
Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!
So...the sewer line backed up into our house last week.
Oh no! That's a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?
It was truly disgusting. We had to have a crew of plumbers come in and dig up our yard.
What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?
My brother got out of prison yesterday! It felt so good to see him after such a long time.
That must have been a great reunion! Who was happier_comma_ him or you?
Definitely me_comma_ I gave him a big bear hug when he walked out those gates.
He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!
The transmission in my car died last week. Such an expensive repair
Ugh_comma_ I hate when unexpected expenses arise.
Fortunately_comma_ my parents offered to loan me the money to fix it.
Well_comma_ that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back.
My friend and I both did a low-carb diet last month. She lost 8 pounds. I gained 2!
Wow_comma_ great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!
I dunno. Water weight? She looks so good now. I'm really envious.
Well_comma_ keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day.
On a whim today_comma_ I bought a scratch off card at 7/11
Please tell me you won a lot of money.
Not a lot - $100. But that's $100 more than I had when I woke up this morning. I was so surprised I did one of those annoying girly squeals at the check out counter
lol That's how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.
My kids spilled juice on my brand new white carpet. I told them not to brink food_comma_ or drinks in the living room. When will they learn?
OH NO! That's infuriating. Did the stain come out?
Yes_comma_ but I had to spend extra money to get the carpet shampooed. I gave them a spanking that they will never forget. I'm not putting up with this no more.
Hopefully they remember
I had a salad for lunch yesterday_comma_ then went shopping at the mall. When I got home around 7pm I discovered I had a HUGE piece of spinach between my front teeth!
Did you brush it right out?
I did. But dozen of people had already seen it. I was mortified. No one told me!
Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?
My friend invited me to a pool party_comma_ but I don't know how to swim. I told her I would think about it.
You could go to the party. And then learn how to swim!
I'm not sure_comma_ I might just stay in the shallow part of the pool.
Yea_comma_ and you can bring some water toys to play with!
I went to a wedding this weekend. I've recently lost a ton of weight so I bought a new dress for the occassion.
Awesome! I bet you felt proud at what you accomplished. Did you have this goal in mind for a while?
Yes. I've wanted to be healthier_comma_ but I also wanted to look hot and feel confident at this event.
How much total weight did you lose_comma_ and how long did it take?
I'm leaving for vacation on Wednesday!
Thats awesome.  I wish I could go.  Where are you going?
On a cruise to Havana. I'm so excited!
Cruises are awesome.  You get to eat as much food as you want.  You'll probably put on like 10 pounds
I got caught in a huge rainstorm last week. It was a deludge.
Aww man_comma_ I hope you brought your raincoat.
Thankfully I had remembered to put an umbrella in my bag before I left the house.
That's good_comma_ you don't want to get soaked and catch a cold.
My brother in the army showed up at my football event yesterday. I wasn't expecting him to come. I thought he was still stationed in Iraq.
That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!
Totally_comma_ I was in shock.
Did you get a video of it?
Once_comma_ at a Waffle House near Memphis_comma_ I heard a man order 15 eggs over-easy.
Gee_comma_ he must have been really hungry! That's a lot of eggs!
I stayed to watch to see if he'd eat them all. He did. I was very impressed.
Wow.. that's unbelievable. I wonder how his cholesterol is.
TSA made me pull down my pants in front of everybody at the airport yesterday. They thought I was a bomb threat.
Oh dang_comma_ that really sucks. I can't believe TSA would go that far_comma_ it must've been super embarrassing.
Yeah_comma_ I will never show my face there again.
Dude_comma_ you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it.
I rode the largest roller coaster I've ever ridden this summer.
Oh yeah_comma_ what was it called? I really love roller coasters!
Millenium Force_comma_ in Cedar Point. It was utterly terrifying.
I saw that one on TV. It looks absolutely nuts. I hope to visit Cedar Point one day!
I'm waiting to hear back from a few colleges about scholarships.
Oh_comma_ I hope you get some good news. I am sure it would help you getting aid for college.
Yes_comma_ I think my stats are good. I'm hopeful there will be some good news soon.
All you can do is be patient and see what happens. I am sure everything will work out for you.
My best friend is getting married next weekend. I'm in the wedding.
That's awesome. I hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee. Are you excited to be there?
Super excited! These two have been together forever. It's about time they made it legit!
Well I am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day. Enjoy the after party!
I went to a fancy art showing at a gallery last night.
Wow_comma_ that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?
It was watercolors. My neighbor was the artist. I had no idea she did such great work. She also has two toddlers. I have no idea how she manages all of that.
Gee_comma_ she must have her hands full! I hope she does well as an artist!
I thought I could lift_comma_ but my wife upstaged me by benching 150 lbs at the gym the other day. I can only lift 130 lbs.
Did you feel very emasculated by this?
No_comma_ it actually turned me on. I didn't know she was that strong.
Yeah_comma_ I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!
My son came back from a camping trip last night. I was great to have him safely home again.
I'm glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip?
He did. I'm a worrier_comma_ but I need to learn to let go more.
My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!
I came across my wedding albums the other day and showed them to my kids.
Oh wow_comma_ I bet the emotions of that came back to you.
Yes_comma_ it was so much fun to see the younger version of me and my husband_comma_ pre-kids. Very sentimental.
Yes_comma_ those memories are what make life so special.
I got a car for my birthday_comma_ but I kinda knew I was going to get it beforehand because I kept telling my wife I wanted it.
So_comma_ not a surprise_comma_ but still nice to get?
Yeah_comma_ kind of ruined the surprise_comma_ but I can always count on my wife to make me feel special.
That's sweet.
I donated $1_comma_000 to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It's for a great cause that's very important to me.
Wow_comma_ thats very admirable of you.  People who abuse animals are the worst kind of people.
I agree_comma_ we should protect and nurture animals_comma_ not abuse them.
I have 2 dogs myself and I could never imagine hurting them.  I can't believe there are people out there who think that that is ok. its sick.
i miss my childhood and living with my parents
Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world.
yes indeed.  i wish i had my treehouse back that my dad built for me.  i would live in it.
That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.
i grew up in the country_comma_ it was a great place to grow up.
i live next to a football field and every football season i hate living here
Oh yeah_comma_ why is that?
Because they park in my driveway!
I would have them towed!
i have signs up this year_comma_ so i can do that legally!
Oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?
Yes. Which i think is wrong.  If they are on my property i should have the right without the sign.
Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.
my husband treated me to a week at disney_comma_ i had no idea!
That's awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?
disney world. it's the only one Ive ever been to .
Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!
Oh my_comma_ you must be there every day then!
i am pretty happy right now_comma_ i don't think i have ever been happier with my life.
That's good that you found happiness. That's what were all in the pursuit of right?
Exactly! I used to struggle but i don't anymore
You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy.
I do every chance i get_comma_ and thank you!
My daughter went out of town_comma_ but she promised me she wouldn't do anything I wouldn't approve of_comma_ and I believe her_comma_ so I let her go.
that's great that you can trust her.  how old?
Yeah_comma_ she's a good kid and hasn't given me any reason to think otherwise. She just turned 18.
That's great. Be thankful_comma_ some people aren't so lucky.
Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing at Walmart!
what did you almost buy?
It was a combination rice-cooker and vegetable steamer.  It looked so good in the ad_comma_ but when I got there_comma_ it looked cheap and shabby!
It's hard to find good quality at walmart
I hope I can find one that lives up to the promise of that ad.  Maybe somwhere else_comma_ right?
I would try target.  good quality stuff there.
I could try online_comma_ but I'd have to buy it first and then see if it's good quality.
try googling it_comma_ and read thru the reviews
i am trying to sell my house_comma_ i hope i can find a buyer
Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?
I hope i do.  We will see_comma_ I know it can take a while.\
Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate_comma_ right?  Location_comma_ Location_comma_ Location.
yes i live behind a school.
Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then
yes_comma_ but i will leave that to the listing agent.
You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?
I had to leave my last job because this manager they brought in was such an incompetent doofus.
Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?
He was the "marketing manager" but couldn't market his way out of a paper bag_comma_ it was impossible to work with him. Plus he thought he knew everything which made it worse.
Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now_comma_ with a manager who cares.
I am actually_comma_ thank you for caring!
i am concerned about my father
Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?
he is old_comma_ and he lives alone.  i just worry because he is getting old.  he gets on ok_comma_ but i don't know how much longer.
Aw_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not easy to watch our parents age.
no it's not_comma_ but hopefully our kids will do the same for us some day.
We can surely hope!
My neighbor asked me to watch over his dog. I told him he could trust me_comma_ but he escaped and ran away.
That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?
I feel so bad. I forgot to lock the gate. No_comma_ but I put up a lot of posters_comma_ so hopefully I find him before my neighbor comes back.
I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.
I used to have this obnoxious neighbor who stayed up all night playing League of Legends_comma_ he drove me nuts screaming into his headset all hours of the day and night.
Doesn't he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?
His parents paid his bills so no_comma_ he didn't understand that sadly. I tried talking to him about it but clearly he didn't get the picture as he kept doing it.
You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.
i have a new job offer_comma_ but im not sure if i should take it
What is causing you to question whether it's the right thing for you or not?
well_comma_ it is retail.  ive done retail and it is not fun.
Yeah_comma_ I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job_comma_ considering dealing with the public_comma_ hours during holiday seasons_comma_ etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good_comma_ it can outweigh some of the negatives.
that's true. i don't like dealing with people.
So this one time I walked in on my cat using the toilet by himself. He just taught himself to do it_comma_ I had no idea how or why but it was pretty cool.
lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro _comma_ thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time
I know which movie you're talking about! I think they actually had to train that cat to do it. Mine just... learned.
wow _comma_ i would love to have a cat like yours
I went to a concert by myself because all my friends were too busy doing other things.
Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?
It was a Marilyn Manson concert. I was even dancing by myself.
haha that must have been a crazy concert!
This friend of mine is constantly job hopping_comma_ I don't even know what she does technically but she seems to get good jobs so easily_comma_ whereas when I left my last job I could barely get interviews.
Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as_comma_ say_comma_ an administrative job
She's in banking so there are definitely a lot of available jobs. And there seems to be a lot of turnover so you're probably right.
Well_comma_ I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture
I am ready to start renovating the rest of my house.
OOO I love doing that_comma_ but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?
I finished my kitchen_comma_ so the next room is going to be my family room.  Just painting it really.
Still_comma_ a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!
Oh yes_comma_ we haven't decided on the color yet.
This morning I woke up and I was in such a good mood that I just started singing in the shower.
That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?
I don't know_comma_ I think it was because I had a dream about marrying Scarlett Johansson.
Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!
I went through my closet the other day and found all these old writings and drawings I did when I was in elementary school. It was fun remembering being that little_comma_ how different the world was.
I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff
Did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? I'm surprised how much my mom kept!
Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids
For my birthday last year_comma_ a coworker gave me cheese. It sounds ridiculous but I was touched by her thoughtfulness. I love cheese!
I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?
Smoked gouda_comma_ one of my favorites! I ate it all in a day haha
Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?
YES. Basically anything meat and cheese and I am totally there!
My cat had really bad breath so I took her in to the dentist. It turned out almost all of her teeth needed to be pulled_comma_ poor thing was in so much pain.
Aww poor baby_comma_ hopefully shes doing fine now.
She's doing great_comma_ thanks! It was a tough recovery for a few days but then you could tell she felt SO much better.
That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.
When I was a kid_comma_ I remember telling my mom to take me to McDonald's_comma_ just so I could get the toy in my Happy Meal. I didn't even care about the food.
Ha_comma_ I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.
Right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling.
True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!
I'm so nervous. I had a job interview the other day and haven't heard back yet.
Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?
They said within the week_comma_ I know it's only been a few days but I'm excited about the opportunity!
I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!
Unfortunately_comma_ I accidentally sent an email to a coworker essentially complaining about her attitude. I really wanted to dig myself in a hole and never come out.
Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)
I've kind of avoided her a bit. I'm trying to come up with an apology that feels heartfelt. It's a horrible feeling!
I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like "okay_comma_ so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email?" Heartfelt apologies go a long way_comma_ and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying.
I went to a restaurant and the waitress put things on our bill that I did not order.
Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?
It had everything we ordered plus a couple things at the bottom we didn't order.
I would have complained.
Oh_comma_ I did_comma_ she immediately said ok I'll take it off like it happened all the time. Made me think it was done on purpose just to see if I  wouldn't notice.
Since most of my family is either dead or lives a few states away_comma_ I usually spend Thanksgiving alone. It sucks sometimes.
Ohh_comma_ I feel sorry for you
Oh don't feel bad_comma_ I live a lovely life and have many friends. It's just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year.
Ohh_comma_ that's bad. You can always skype your family!
I spent the entire other weekend cleaning my apartment. It sucked at the time but it was so nice when I was done to just chill out and watch TV.
Yes_comma_ I feel you. Cleaning sucks_comma_ but after all that hard work_comma_ the results are amazing!
Right? It's so rewarding when you're finished and everything smells good. I love that feeling.
Me too! You seem just like me!
My husband and I closed on our first house last week!
That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?
It is! Lots of blood_comma_ sweat and tears - and lots of phone calls and signing things_comma_ haha. We can't wait to move in!
That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness_comma_ joy and fun times!
my daughter moved to California and a few months later she got in a car accident and was on the other side of the country so there was nothing I could immediately do.
Are there any other family members out there that could help her?
No. She asked her friend to call me after it happened but wasn't able to tell me many details.
Wow_comma_ I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home_comma_ but I'm sure she figured something out.
They took her to the hospital for evaluation but she ended up just being a bit bruised up. I was worried something like this would happen. Everything did work out in the end though.
Recently I was contacted by my former company_comma_ begging to get me back. I felt really good about the salary negotiation since I knew they needed me.
That's great! I am happy for you!
Thanks_comma_ I'm happy about it. I only have to work a few hours a week_comma_ it's pretty amazing.
Yeah_comma_ and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!
i was shocked to learn that i had been called to serve on a jury !
i honestly have never gone to jury duty _comma_ but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule
yes i am not looking forward to it.  ive heard that its just awful.
same thing i heard too _comma_ really long and boring being there against your will
yes i think it is going to be a long week or so.
My dog died this past December and I've had a really hard time getting over it. She was our family pet.
I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past_comma_ so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.
She really was a wonderful pet. We just got a puppy recently_comma_ which is the same breed as the one who passed away. She's bringing some light back into our lives.
Aww that's great! What breed?
The worst day of my life was when I was 8 months pregnant with our first child and I started bleeding like crazy.
Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?
Yes_comma_ thankfully everything turned out fine. I had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital though!
Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me_comma_ I can't imagine being there for that long
my doggie recently passed away
I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.
no i don't think so_comma_ but it was violent.  she was run over by a car.
Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!
i don't think i will ever know. they usually don't stop when that happens.
The other day I woke up and without looking I stepped in warm cat vomit.
oh man_comma_ that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.
Yeah it was pretty gross but one of my cats is pretty pukey_comma_ I should have known better and watched where I was walking.
how many cats do have?
Well right now I have six but they're not all mine_comma_ I foster for a cat rescue. Three are mine_comma_ three are for adoption. It gets crazy in my house!
My dog died last year.
Aw_comma_ I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?
About 5 years. He was a rescue.
They say dogs are mans best friend.
That's true. He was definitely mine.
What kind of dog was he?
He was a pit and lab mix.
Nice_comma_ I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere.
The worst phone call I ever got in my life was when I was told my dad only had a few weeks left to live.
Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago_comma_ I know how terrible that feels.
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going on just over two years. Never thought it would happen to us.
Neither did we. He seemed so healthy_comma_ and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day_comma_
They will live on in our love and memories. I hope the heaviness lessens one day at a time <3
The other day I checked my email and a former client I did some freelance work had emailed me a gift card out of the blue! I was happy.
surprise gifts are always fun.
Very! I decided since it was surprise money I would waste it on something fun.
that sounds like a well deserved plan.
I remember the first I went to a theme park.  I had been planning on the way there not to go on any roller coasters_comma_ but just being there changed my mind quickly.
Oh man_comma_ I can relate_comma_ that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment
Exactly.  I just saw how much fun it looked and I thought to myself I should just live a little.  It's not often you get to have experiences like that.
Life is full of experiences like that_comma_ they seem scary from the outside_comma_ but once you relax you get swept away
i lost $100 cash somewhere. I have looked everywhere and i can't find it
that sounds prettty bad!
yes_comma_ i have retraced my steps and i can't find it.  hopefully i will find it when i need it the most.
I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.
i have looked everywhere. it's so frustrating.
Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!
I really hate when people let their kids run wild in public. I do believe kids should be kids but there is a time and place for it.
I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think.
The worst is when they're screaming at them rather than just speaking to them calmly.
The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.
I wanted to go and get the tissue that was on sale was so bummed it was sold out.
What store were you at?
I was going to Walgreen's and they was out and the sale began today.
Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer?
It get's worse no rain check but they insist on giving me customer service number to still receive points towards my card.
it was my birthday and felt like no one really cared
Aw man_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?
thanks! my coworker went out on lunch break and bought my favorite ice cream cake!
Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.
yes she is honestly the greatest
That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.
I completely ate the last cupcake even though I know my husband will want one when he gets home. Should I go get some more?
Oh_comma_ I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets_comma_ but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol
Right! It's almost like_comma_ you knew this was going to happen. I feel terrible but it was so good lol. I'll get him some more tomorrow!
That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.
I was at the store the other day and the lady ahead of me had no idea how to use self checkout_comma_ I wish she would have used the regular line instead of holding everyone up.
Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.
Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate.
Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.
We can only hope.
When I was in high school there was a girl I had liked for a long time that ended up dating my best friend.
Oh man_comma_ that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?
Yes. But at the time she was unavailable. Then when she wasn't spoken for my "friend" asked her out.
Sounds like your friend broke bro code_comma_ that was kind of scummy.
I had mentioned to my friend one day that my computer was pretty much on its way out.  Some time later I found that he had sent me the money to buy a new one.
Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that
Yea I was really thankful and appreciative for it.  He's like a brother to me.
That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times
It really does.  I think when it comes to friends quality is better than quantity.  I like to have friends that feel like family.
I cried so hard seeing my baby girl walk across the stage at her VPK graduation.
That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now
Yes this is a new milestone and now she get's to see what real school is all about with all age groups.
That's awesome_comma_ she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!
I entered a raffle at a local fair and actually won $1000.
Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?
Oh they are long gone_comma_lol. Bills to pay and all.
Bills do take up a lot_comma_ don't they.
They sure do. The raffle did allow me to get ahead of things for a while though.
One time I moved into a new apartment_comma_ it was this big loft in a converted warehouse. I had this automatic soap dispenser that went nuts on me and made this really scary sound_comma_ I thought the place was haunted!
Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?
Haha yeah it was pretty funny once I realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was.
How did you discover exactly what it was?
I turned off the TV and my phone and tried to trace the sound to its source. I feel ridiculous about it now in hindsight!
I have a fear for roller coaster but I let my siblings talk me into getting on one last night.
Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?
Fun but scary I couldn't wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride.
I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!
My hands was up and feeling the wind in my face and facing my fears but I kept them closed because I just couldn't look because of the height lol.
I had to put my cat down a few years ago_comma_ she was old and in kidney failure.
I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.
She had a good life. She was actually my mom's cat_comma_ she came to live with me when my mom died.
You went through a lot of losses.
Someone buggy was in the way at Publix and I tripped and fell in the aisle.
That sounds painful_comma_ I hope you were okay after your fall.
I was ok just the look on m face let you know I was ashamed lol I turned red instantly.
Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing_comma_ but I'm glad you're okay.
I applied for a job one time where I was one of 4 people being considered for it and had to wait a week to find out if I got it.
Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!
I did get it! If I was a praying kind of guy I would have done so every day. I was o nervous.
Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?
I remember being younger and waiting on Christmas Day to unwrap presents.  There were a lot of things I wanted that year.
I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?
Well I was really looking forward to the Super Nintendo.  It had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one.
The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?
Yea_comma_ they tried to trick me and wrap a box of clothes the same size to make me think I didn't get it.  My favorite game has to be Earthbound.
I fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people. It was kind of humiliating.
Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?
You're right_comma_ the other people probably hardly noticed. And no_comma_ thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.
I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!
That's solid advice_comma_ thank you. And yes_comma_ I own a helmet_comma_ but admittedly don't wear it as often as I should. I will now!
This one year right after I moved to the east coast we had this scary hurricane warning. I went ahead and stocked up on all the basics; batteries_comma_ canned goods_comma_ beer. I was set!
How'd the hurricane go?
Wouldn't you know it totally missed my city. I was a little let down to be honest_comma_ though glad we were safe.
Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.
I was going on a trip and couldn't take my dog so I had to board him and I was so worried about it.
Was he okay?
He was fine. I just didn't know how he was going to handle it_comma_ he is a very nervous dog.
Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.
That's true. He was a rescue and sometimes I wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that.
Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.
I like to think he does. I just hope he is as happy as he makes me.
I bet he is. Don't worry
I usually food prep for the week it is so much easier.
That is a great idea
Yes it works out great saves me money and keeps my scheduled arranged and on track.
Saving money is important
My daughter graduated high school as a straight A student last year
That's amazing! You must be so proud.
Oh I am. It's nice to know that I raised a child with a good head on her shoulders.
She's also a hard worker.
I like to think so_comma_ although it seemed to alwasy be easy for her.
Yesterday my Lyft driver offered to carry my groceries up to my apartment. I thought that was super nice_comma_ there were A LOT of bags.
That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.
It was sweet. And I told him not to worry about it_comma_ I didn't want to hold him up.
Good to know there is still kind people in the world.
I got some pink roses at work last week I was so happy.
That's awesome! Who were they from?
My husband but I didn't expect it I was so surprised they was a just because gift.
That was really sweet of him_comma_ maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.
I am about to leave on a 17 hour car trip with my husband_comma_ our four kids_comma_ and 2 dogs. I think I have everything ready to go though
You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.
I hope so. I even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough.
That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!
I sent an email I shouldn't have sent. I'd been drinking and totally should have saved it rather than sending it when I did.
We all do things we regret when drinking
True. The funny thing was I obsessed over it for days_comma_ worrying I made a mistake. And absolutely nothing happened! I worried for nothing.
Thats usually how it goes
A few years ago I decided to move cross-country. It was kind of terrifying taking a huge leap like that with no job and hardly knowing anyone here.
You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?
It definitely has had its ups and downs but overall I'm really glad I did it. I don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon that's for sure.
hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.
I'm going back to school I am going to stick to my goal and don't stop until I get my degree.
I wish you luck
Thanks I am super excited I know I will have a great outcome I have goals to meet.
I am sure you will meet them
I spent my birthday last year alone. I expected my boyfriend to make plans but nope.
That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?
Yeah_comma_ he acted like it was just a normal day_comma_ it was so weird. Maybe I'm getting too old to make a big deal out of birthdays anyway.
I would have been disappointed_comma_ too.
I get so annoyed when it rains I had plans for a family cookout but it started thundering and lightening such a bummer.
Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months.
Yes it's the worse especially in Florida it's sunny one day and pouring down raining the next.
Oh right_comma_ I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.
I went to a book release party yesterday.
Cool. Was it interesting?
Yes. It was a good friend of mine. She got a novel published! She also has four small kids. I'm not sure how she does it all.
Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol
My best friend is moving across the country next week.
ARe you happy or sad?
Sad. I will miss her terribly
I bet. I she moving school or a job?
My job recognized me for my hard work I was thankful and surprised I just love my job.
Oh cool that's great! What were you doing that they recognised?
For over exceeding and helping all staff when in need_comma_ I am always just helpful but was happy to get noticed for my hard work.
Awesome. What is your job?
I work for the state we help clients with disabilities find employment it is case management work.
I got a random email this morning with a $120 gift voucher
Wow was it a scam or was it legit?
I was really sure it was a scam but it turned out it was a prize for a survey I had submitted a few weeks ago!
That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?
Thanks! No idea actually_comma_ it's for a department store here in Australia so will have to look around
There was an "incident" at the gym today.
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
I finished a fabulous workout_comma_ then promptly fell UP the stairs on my way to the locker room. In front of everyone. I was mortified.
Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!
After four long_comma_ broke months of looking_comma_ I finally got offered a job today!
That's great. Are you excited?
Yes_comma_ and incredibly happy. I was getting really worried about the bills.
Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.
I had an email telling me I had a $120 gift voucher this morning
Was it real?
Haha that was my first thought too. It actually was!
That's awesome. What are you going to buy?
Thanks! No idea actually_comma_ it's for a department store here in Australia
Australia. I hope to go there some day
You definitely should! It's a really cool place_comma_ but so hard to see everything because it's so big
I bet_comma_ I will get there one day
I knocked over a clothing display on the sidewalk outside of a boutique the other day when I was riding my bike. I should have gone back to pick it up but kept going.
I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother
I hope not. Now that you mention it I'm sure it happens all the time.
Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks
I was waiting for a while for a video game to come out.  When it finally did it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.
That has happend to me too.
I got my hopes up too much. I should wait for reviews to come out before I rush out and buy next time.
You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though
That's very true.  Which is why I prefer physical discs most of the time.
We live and we learn lol
Exactly.  Next time I'm waiting for prices to drop_comma_ months after launch.
The other day I was listening to Spotify and put U2's Achtung Baby on. It reminds me of pre middle school days.
I used to love that band
Yeah they were great back in the day. I can't comment on their new stuff_comma_ I haven't listened to any of it in years.
I have not either
So the cable repair guy was supposed to show up between 8:30 and 12:30 on Friday. Guess when he showed up....
Probably at 4 or 5! lol
You got it. 5:00. WHY does this still happen? I wasted the whole day waiting.
No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?
I got a random email telling me I had won a gift card
Was it real because I get those every day lol
Haha yeah it actually turned out to be real! It was for $120
I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol
We had a near-disaster at our house today.
oh no! what happened?
My older son called from the bathroom that we were out of toilet paper. It seemed...um...urgent....Fortunately_comma_ we had an emergency stash in the laundry room.
ah_comma_ crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse
We went to our favorite Italian restaurant for dinner tonight.
Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.
It was good! It always is. I had my "usual" pasta and just enough wine to feel relaxed_comma_ but not loopy. It was a good way to end a Sunday.
That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy
I didn't have a pen while returning a rental car to an unattended location
Hm_comma_ that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation_comma_ since I've never had to rent a car. What exactly happened_comma_ or what did that mean?
Yeah I was travelling in the US and they just had a drop box where you put the keys and a form in. Luckily I asked a stranger who was passing by and they gave me a really nice pen to keep
Oh_comma_ so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm_comma_ no foul.
I recently got an email from my old company hinting that they wanted me back. It was kind of exciting_comma_ I really wanted it to work out.
I bet that was a nice feeling
It definitely was. The money is great and I get to set my own hours!
That sounds perfect
I have a dentist appointment first thing tomorrow morning.
The dentist makes me a bit nervous
It makes me VERY nervous. I hate it. I'll probably barely sleep tonight because of it.
Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!
I got back from vacation last week and found a huge dent in my car.
That is awful_comma_ did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number?
No. They just hit it and left the airport parking lot. I'm pretty incensed.
You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot_comma_ maybe they can track down the car.
I went to the fanciest dinner party the other night. It was  eight amazing courses of food!
What kind of food was there?
Really intricate things - souffles and such. I was very impressed.
It is nice that you enjoyed it.
I saw a mouse run across my kitchen last night. I woke everyone up with my screaming.
Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?
Stood on the couch and screamed some more! I do not do rodents. I'm having my son handle it. I think he's putting out traps tonight.
Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well
My kitty that I had since she was a kitten passed away. She was only four years old.
Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.
It really is. She was the first pet that was really "mine". She brought a lot of happiness to my life!
It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well_comma_ just think of all the good times and be thankful.
I had a test the other day and I'm pretty sure I aced it. I studied for like a week!
That's great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests
Same here. I never had to study for high school but when I hit college_comma_ it was a wakeup call.
Oh yes. But_comma_ I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle_comma_ but important diffeence
So all my friends went on vacation last week :(
Judging by the :(_comma_ I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?
Yeah_comma_ we were supposed to go but I couldn't get off work. I got to see all the pictures on Facebook though_comma_ ha! So envious.
I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D
Sounds like a plan :)
I hope where ever you go_comma_ you visit someplace amazing!
Man I am stuffed.  I found a new pizza joint in town.
That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?
Yeah I definitely like a lot of pizza.  This place had a all you can eat buffet.  I ate my fill of pizza!
You are lucky.
I made sure it was the only thing I ate all day.  I was pretty content.
Man I couldn't get any sleep last night.
Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?
There was something scratching on my window.  I was pretty nervous.
Hopefully you had a lock on them_comma_ you can never be too safe.
Well that's the thing.  when I looked out in the morning I didn't see anything.
One year for our anniversary_comma_ an iPad showed up at my office. My boyfriend had ordered it and timed it so arrived on our exact anniversary. I didn't expect it at all!
Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.
He's generous yeah but I wouldn't call it "showering." He's just good about knowing what I need!
That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!
I used to enjoy cold showers in the morining.
I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?
It's very cold and refreshing_comma_ wakes you up instantly.
I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !
My neighbor refuses to clean up after her dog and it's infuriating.
wow that is very rude of her
It really is. I'm not sure what to do though besides reporting her to the HOA. Any suggestion?
No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me
Lucky you! For some reason I seem to be attracted to apartments filled with rude people.
What else do we need_comma_ just a sunny bench and some chips.
I totally agree. That actually sounds really good rihgt now.
So lets go_comma_ I'll meet you outside in an hour.
Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!
I am looking forward for tomorrow.
I will be expecting to see you there.
Yes_comma_ tomorrow as well as today are such a nice places.
Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.
I was walking around town yesterday and saw a girl with crazy hairstyle.
Interesting.  What was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?
It was...Dandelion.
Is that a reference to the color of the hair_comma_ the shape or something else?
Man I felt good when I applied for my job!
How did it go? That's an anxiety-inducing but hopeful situation!
No I was very assured in my interview.  I got the job_comma_ probably because of my attitude.
Congratulations! Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.
I could definitely feel it going to other way if I was defeatist in my interview.
Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly_comma_ once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality.
It can be_comma_ but personality can't make up for incomptence either.
I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't_comma_ maybe they aren't good employers.
I flipped through my high school yearbooks the other day for the first time in a long time. I can't believe how much time has passed.
Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!
Enjoy it_comma_ your 30s go by really fast. I'm clinging desperately to the last few years of mine myself.
I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.
It's very strange when you meet somebody you know_comma_ in the middle of a megalopolis.
Yeah_comma_ it's like a small world.
Exactly_comma_ how does it even work?
I think it is merely a coincidence.
Small thing in life used to make me shed tears.
Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?
Yes_comma_ things like great classical music for example.
Oh_comma_ I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry
We have to stay positive through all the things that happen in the world.
I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times.
Yes_comma_ that's a good start.
Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important.
Someone my husband used to work with got a promotion and a really big raise.
That's awesome!  What do they do?
They work in the oil field. My husband left the company they both worked for and I can't help but think if he still worked their he would have gotten a raise too.
That would be nice_comma_ but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.
Last week driving to work_comma_ I got pulled over for speeding.
That sucks. How fast were you driving?
Only a couple miles over. It's always a terrible thing to see those lights in your mirror.
I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit
I haven't drank beer in almost a year_comma_ but yesterday I relapsed. I feel like such a loser.
Oh man_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow
I just can't believe I gave in to the pressure. Oh well_comma_ yeah your right. I'll start by taking baby steps.
Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans_comma_ we make mistakes.
My neighbor is remodeling his house_comma_ which I hate_comma_ because they start at 5:30 in the morning.
That is probably so annoying
I have a 3 year old_comma_ so he wakes up at 5:30 because of all the hammering going on.
That really sucks. How long will it be going on?
My wife told me she's pregnant the other day. I was baffled by the news because the doctor told us she only had a ten percent chance of having a baby.
Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky_comma_ depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?
Yeah_comma_ it just came at an unexpected time. I really want a little boy.
Well_comma_ then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck_comma_ and enjoy this time! :)
I went to see a movie last night. I wasn't really able to enjoy it though.
Why not?
There was this couple sitting two rows in front of me.... they just wouldn't shut up.
Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.
I saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. It was alright_comma_ but I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first.
I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again?
I might. It just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger.
right_comma_ i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!!
My mom called me about a year ago and told me she had cancer.
Is she doing okay now?
Yes_comma_ she had a really difficult 6 months and then things started improving.
great_comma_ I am very glad to hear she is getting better!
I was very pleased to get this job
What is the job?
I got the job has an software Analysis and that was aim
Well congrats then_comma_ I am sure that is not easy
A little bit. But when we doing it in a rightway from our heart really it will be easy
I was so angry_comma_ I threw a bottle of water!
What caused that to happen?
A server went down and I didn't get paid for my work :(
Oh gosh_comma_ hopefully it doesnt happen next time
Yeah I hope not_comma_ I can't afford work stoppages!
i felt nostalgic looking through old photos today
What were the photos of?
just old family photos
It is good to have those and look at once in awhile
A couple months ago_comma_ my wife and I got divorced.
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ what happened?
We just grew apart I guess. House seems so empty with her and the kids gone.
Did you try therapy at all or counseling?
We can't afford to live in our home anymore
Why is that?
We're poor_comma_ and bills are adding up
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ I hope things improve for you a ton!
Thank you! I do as well
Boy_comma_ it's been a lot of owrk
Sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us ... they are many
What sort of things?
I interpret the difficulties
What sort of difficulties/
the lack of humor
Ah_comma_ it's no joke is it
Ok
Last year_comma_ my father passed away.
Oh goodness_comma_ I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?
Yeah_comma_ he developed a stage 4 glioma in his brain that could not be removed.
That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I can't imagine going through that with a loved one.
i feel nostalgic going through old boxes in my basement
What kind of stuff is in there?
just old sports uniforms and toys and stuff like that
Oh okay_comma_ I love going through my old stuff too_comma_ it is really fun
I have plans so go to the beach with my wife for a week next month
That sounds so fun!
I cant wait! we have been looking forward to going back since our honeymoon.
I hope you both have tons of fun!
Thank you. We plan on it!
I'm so glad my health is good
that's great! I'm glad to hear that. we often take our health for granted.
We do_comma_ and don't do enough to take care of it
i'm one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know it's not good for me
Ah_comma_ it'll catch up to you :(
Oh man. I can't believe I made that mistake at work today.
Uh OH what happened
I was giving a presentation on the project that I'm working on_comma_ and I overlooked something simple.... one of my coworkers called me out on it. How embarrassing.
Oh no_comma_ well mistakes do happen_comma_ it will be behind you in a few days
I certainly hope so. The sooner everyone forgets about this_comma_ the better.
Exactly good luck
Thank you_comma_ I'm just glad it was at the end of the presentation so I was able to get out of there shortly after.
I love to see old stuff from when I was a kid
Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff?
Old metal lunch boxes like Charlies Angels speed buggy ect
I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?
Hong Kong Phooey lol
Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid. I never had the lunch box though.
It's time to move!
Oh_comma_ OK!  WHere are you moving to?
Another house_comma_ it's closer to school
That's good!  That will make your life much easier!  Congratulations!
So there's a girl that I've been talking to lately... I'm thinking about asking her out.
That's exciting. Do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes?
Yeah_comma_ I already have it all planned out. We get along really well_comma_ so I'm sure she's going to say yes.
What all is on the agenda for the date?
I'm going to take her to this restaurant she really likes_comma_ then go to a movie. I'm gonna show her a great time.
I've finally finished writing the book that I've been working on for the last few months.
Great. Are you going to get it published?
Definitely! I'm pretty happy with this one_comma_ can't wait to get it published.
What is the book about?
To say anything about it at all would be giving too much away!
Boo. What genre?
Oh man. I was cleaning out my fridge_comma_ and found something unpleasant.
OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?
Well I threw it out. It was some unidentifiable stuff in a plastic container. It had been in there for months_comma_ I think.
You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again
You know_comma_ that's not a bad idea. Ugh_comma_ it was so disgusting.
My little one got injured
Oh no! What happened?
She fell off a kitchen stool
Ouch. I hope she's okay.
Whew. I had a lot of housework to get done_comma_ but it's finally finished.
thats good_comma_ its always a good feeling after
Yeah_comma_ I'm pretty happy. Now I can just sit back and relax.
thats the way to do it
I agree. Now I don't have anything to worry about for the rest of the day.
i was delighted with how well my nephew did at his little league game
Did his team win?
yes
That's great news! I bet you're so proud.
My clothing is making me crazy
Oh no!  Why are they driving you crazy?
They're totally itchy
That is no good!  I guess it is time for you to go shopping!
i admired the way my nieghbors helped each other out after a storm
Storms are the worst and destroy so much.
they are horrible_comma_ luckily this one wasnt deadly or too destructive
My family went through a big storm a few years ago.
I got a terrible phone call yesterday...
what happened on the phone call?
I found out that my brother died.
I am so sorry about that.
Thank you_comma_ I'm pretty devastated to be honest.
Ugh_comma_ my cat keeps attacking my foot.
Has it made any scratch marks?
Nah_comma_ he just keeps running up_comma_ grabbing and biting_comma_ then running away. It was cute and funny at first_comma_ now it's just irritating.
Have you tried disciplining him in anyway
Yeah_comma_ I've sprayed him with a water bottle a few times_comma_ it doesn't seem to work very well.
Sounds like it's time for a crate.
it is frustrating waiting on hold to speak to a human
Yea_comma_ I hate calling ATT or Verizon they take forever to get on the phone.
it is so annoying!
I think as we get smarter_comma_ it will get better.
I didn't expect to get anything for my birthday from my fiance since he's been broke_comma_ but he gave me a bouquet of flowers and took me out to eat still!
Wow!  Sounds like a keeper right there!  That must have been a nice surprise for you!
It really was! He had to scrimp and save_comma_ but it was worth it for both of us in the end :)
It is always nice when someone gets their priorities right!
So.... my dog got hit by a car last night.
Oh no!  That is horrible!  Is he OK?
No_comma_ unfortunately he didn't make it.
That is really sad!  I hope it was quick and painless.  I hate seeing anything suffer!
Yeah_comma_ I think it was_comma_ but... I'm pretty upset about it.
My son asked to borrow the keys to my car this morning.
Did you let him borrow it?
Yeah. I know most people would be worried about doing something like that_comma_ but... I trust him not to do anything stupid.
That's good to hear. I assume everything went ok?
Yeah_comma_ he brought it back in one piece. Which I'm obviously happy about.
Awesome. Alls well that ends well.
My daughter asked to borrow my car to go out tonight...
Did you say yes?
I haven't given an answer yet. I'm just not sure if it's a wise idea or not.
Where does she plan to go?
She says she's just going to meet some friends at the movies_comma_ but you know how teenagers are.
Boy_comma_ it was nice when I wasn't so poor
Money problems are never fun. Trust me_comma_ I know.
I'm sorry to hear that :( It'd be nice if work paid better
Yeah_comma_ definitely. Have you tried asking for a raise?
I was sad when I had to put my dog down last month
Oh no_comma_ I'm so so sorry. I've always had at least one pet throughout my life_comma_ and they're truly part of the family.
They are very much family. I cannot believe we get so attached.
Yes_comma_ they're honestly more dear to me than my friends. I hope you're doing okay - I'm sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life_comma_ so try to take comfort in that.
I was recently promoted at my job. I didn't expect it to happen_comma_ but I got it through hard work so I'm pretty excited about it!
That is great! Doing what?
Thank you! I'm now a district manager for a local chain of businesses. It's not my favorite thing to do_comma_ but the raise is great!
I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!
I recently went on a long road trip. I wasn't too worried_comma_ though_comma_ because I packed everything I needed to make it as stress-free as possible. '
I can never go on long trips.
Why not? They used to bother me_comma_ but I'm finding that as I get older_comma_ they're not so bad.
I can no longer afford them_comma_ long trips cost the most.
That's unfortunate. I've come to enjoy taking a train as a frugal alternative to flying or driving. No wear and tear on your car_comma_ and you don't have to drive.
I kept laughing at myself for falling down
Oh no!. Are you ok? Must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?
Not bad but it was funny because I slipped on a banana peel!
How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.
I compete in the Highland games around the country. I just got a new kilt and I look amazing.
I am bad at every game.
It's a little different. It's based in picking up and throwing objects like logs_comma_ hammers that weight 70 pounds and stones that weight 70 pounds. Being Scottish it keeps me feeling at home.
I still could not do that_comma_ I am very weak human person.
You can do anything you set your mind to.
I've been very stressed out at work. I had it in my budget so I hired a new office manager. I'm having issues trusting her.
Do what i did_comma_ quit the job and live at home with mom.
I wish. My mom kicked me out at 14 and I've only seen her a handful of times since over the last 20 years.
I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.
I actually really want to buy a van and live in it but my wife said no.
I just pulled up my student loan bill. I've been out of school 10 years and still owe 75k.
That's awful! Luckily I paid all mine off_comma_ but I know many people still struggle with it
It started off at 150k so I've paid a lot but it's still crazy. Make me think I would have been better off to just go work construction or something instead of college.
Yea...the education costs are atrocious and_comma_ honestly_comma_ not even worth it on my opinion. It's just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so
I agree. I feel like I've learned just as much or more from MOCC's since then.
My boss is piling on the work but keeping my pay the same. He claims he can't afford to pay me more_comma_ but I know that's not true.
Typical of most companies.  Ask employees to do more and pay less.
Yep_comma_ it's so frustrating. I'm ready to shake up the system but I feel limited in what I can do_comma_ besides quit.
What kind of job do you have?
I'm so shocked_comma_ my pants fell down in public
I'm sorry_comma_ did anyone see?
I'm hoping not_comma_ but it's possible
I hope you would wear a belt next time.
LOL Yes_comma_ I learned my lesson
My best friend has the best job ever. She is paid to travel the world full time and write Blogs on different locations.
That sounds like a blast.  Compared to my job LOL.
Yes_comma_ I know. Ever day I drive an hour to the same place that is slowly killing me inside and she is jetting off to explore.
I'm sorry.  I like my job but its certainly not like hers!
Just finished my budget for the week. Woowa_comma_ I'm in trouble it's going to be a rice and beans week.
LOL.  Be careful.. thats a ton of carbs.
It's better then the alternative. One good meal then water and ketchup soup the rest of the week.
eww LOL
Yea_comma_ Rice and beans is so much better then that.
I just had my birthday_comma_ and my family and fiance did everything they could to make it special. I don't have much_comma_ but I'm thankful to have them at least.
Happy Birthday!
Thank you! I hope your birthday_comma_ whenever it is_comma_ is awesome as well!
What all did they do for you?
Got a big bouquet of flowers_comma_ they took me out to eat (lunch and dinner)_comma_ and we went to the drive-in to top it off :)
I was proud when my dog learned to sit.
How long did it take for you to teach you dog that?
A few days. He was so happy!
I thought I would take longer_comma_ like months!
This week my work offered to let me work an extra day. I thought great overtime. Nope they plan to send me home every other day to even it out
Oh no. Maybe you can get some things done around the house.
Yea like working on my resume and netflix.
Lol_comma_ That sounds like a plan. Working two jobs is hard.
I'm so happy I ate good food
Yummy... what did you eat?  I am hungry.
I had chicken_comma_ asparagus_comma_ and a portobello mushroom
That sounds so good.  Like I love that stuff.
I"m so happy that no one in my family is sick
I am glad no one in your family is sick.
Thank you! I hope no one in yours is either
Thank goodness my family is healthy too.
went for a job interview. I got the job offer but they offered me less money then I all ready make for more work.
But do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits. It may be worth it still_comma_
Not for the first few years. The title would be a move up in status but the pay is about a 20% downgrade. I can't take that loss.
Benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes
I'm so excited to go out to dinner tomorrow!
is there a special reason?
No_comma_ we just won't be home so we have to eat out
going anywhere good?
Pickle Barrel
that sounds fun
I'm been loosing weight January. I'm down 50 pounds. I have 10 more to go but I'm happy.
That is great. How have you done it?
I've always walked a lot at work. I average 10 miles a day so kept doing that but I cut out all processed food and drinks.
That is a lot of walking. I can hardly walk 1 mile.
I average about 95_comma_000 steps a week.
My wife went on a trip for a week to see her family but I had to work so I had to stay home alone.
I have never been on a trip before.
I wish I could have went on this one but I couldn't. It ended up bein a long week by myself.
I have long weeks every single day.
My current job isn't working out_comma_ so I've applied to several others.
I would just quit and live off the government.
Haha_comma_ I would if I could! Sounds a like much more laidback way to live.
Everyone can! Just gotta try.
I found a new stray dog eating out the dumpster last Thursday. Today I officially adopted her.
how sweet and thoughtful of you
I already love her. This is the second stray I've found eating out the same dumpster. They are now sisters.
You seem to be a very compassionate person_comma_ very kindhearted.
About 6 years ago I was diagnosed with cancer.
Ohh_comma_ I so sorry.
Thank you_comma_ it was a very scary situation to be in.
Hope you are doing better. I'll pray for you.
I'm doing good now after the chemo and radiation. It is in total remission now.
Good for you! stay healthy
I've been trying to eat healthier and work out more_comma_ but so far I've only been somewhat successful.
Forget that! Eat pizza and enjoy life.
Oh I definitely do both of those things as much as I can. Pizza = perfection
I agree_comma_ I eat what I want when I want all the time.
If I had the metabolism to do that_comma_ I'd definitely be following your example.
I'm so scared to move to a new home
You have to have fun!
How can I do that?
Get drunk and go out!
Just got home from the grocery store. Forgot my wallet at home. Got to check out and had to apologize to the cashier and leave with out anything.
I never go to the store anymore_comma_ I wish i did.
Why not? Dollar store has something for everyone.
Not for me_comma_ i shop online mostly these days.
You ship food to your house?
I'm about to start a new job_comma_ and I'm really nervous about it.
Just go for it! Never look back!
Okay_comma_ I'll take your advice! Wish me luck!
Best of luck my friend_comma_ you can do anything.
I get so mad when I watch shows about animal shelters and see how many people abuse animals.
I own an animal shelter here in my home town.
It must be so hard to deal with emotionally at times. Just watching a show makes me want to lash out.
I try to pass that onto my top doctors to take care of the dogs.
My daughter killed the GRE!
That's great! I hope she goes to a good graduate school.
Thank you! Me too :)
I am very happy for you!

thank you. i am having trouble getting over it.
Don't feel bad now. What's done is done
Yes_comma_ but I really miss him.
I can understand. I am really sorry
There was a 2 car accident this morning a driver going the wrong way it had traffic backed up.
Oh no! Was anyone hurt?
Yes one driver was in critical condition and car ran into the side of the express way it was unfortunate but I was over a hour late for work.
That is so sad. I hope they recover okay. Hopefully you weren't in trouble for being late either.
i am excited to see my son and his fiance!
That is awesome_comma_ are they coming to visit you?
Yes! In October. I haven't seen him in a few months.
Awesome! I'm not a father yet_comma_ but I can only imagine your kids growing up and leaving to live their own lives.
Yes_comma_ I do miss them.  But i am excited to see them get out there and leave their mark on the world.
i didn't ask my husband if i could buy something_comma_ now he is mad and i feel bad.
Aw_comma_ I'm sorry_comma_ did you just forget or you were thinking about other things?
I didn't think he would mind.  But it was expensive_comma_ so maybe i should have asked.
Yeah_comma_ had a similar scuffle with my wife_comma_ but being married sometimes you just have to forgive and forget.
The bugs that creep me out the most is those eight legged spiders I seen a huge one in my car this weekend.
I have never liked spiders.
Me either I screamed so loud lol I be afraid thy may crawl on me I would freak out.
You should always have bug spray on you at all times.
For now on I will.
I hear something tapping outside my bathroom door. I don't know what it is and I am really scared.
That is really scary. Are you home alone?
Yes! I don't have a gun or anything!
I'm sure you are fine. I bet it is just a tree branch or something like that. Maybe a neighbor could go look for you.
I don't have any neighbors_comma_ and there are no trees there.
I got a new position at my job more money and also happy to be recognized for my hard work.
YAY_comma_ a promotion is always amazing.  when do you start?
I actually started today it was a lot of information to take in but it was such a joy.
Thats amazing_comma_ financial stability can be a life changer.
I hate going to walmart. People just walk right out in front of you and don't even say excuse me!
Maybe they're very eager to go a certain item.
Maybe. It's that hunter gatherer mentality.  Get it before everyone else.
True_comma_ because regretfully I act that way sometimes too.
I guess I might too.
I love being lazy on weekends. It's nice to just relax and have nothing to worry about.
Yeah I hear you! Do you like to read or watch TV?
Both! I spend more time watching TV though. How about you?
I like to do both as well. TV if I'm feeling lazy_comma_ reading if I feel more ambitious.
That's kind of how I am. What kind of TV shows do you like?
I can be so forgetful I left my windows down in my car and my seats was full of water.
Oh no!! How did you dry them?
They are still air drying what makes it worse I sat in the sets and it looked like I wet myself lol a little embarrassing.
Oh that sounds awful! But at least no one stole anything from your car.
I found a hair in my pizza_comma_ and now I can't eat
Did you take it back that is so disgusting.
I called them and told them about it. They said the next pizza would be free. I said no thanks.
I wouldn't want another either it takes one time for me to find hair_comma_ bug etc and I am done with the restaurant.
Yes indeed.  I think i am done with eating out for a while
Best way to ensure your food is clean and free of hair cook it yourself.
I recently went on a long trip by car. For the first time_comma_ it wasn't stressful because I packed everything I needed for it to run smoothly.
That sounds great! I really pays off to be prepared.
Yes it does. I was able to eliminate several meal breaks which cut over three hours off my trip time!
That sounds like some efficient planning! I hope you enjoy your trip!
Thank you!
Ever since my kids left and went to college I am such a loner.
I can understand you. But this is the cycle of life_comma_ right? Kids grow and they have to find their own way of life in this world
Yes you are right at least I have my cats to keep me company lol so I'm not to much alone.
Good for you. You can also call your friends to hang out if you have close ones
i didn't get to see my favorite character when i went to disney world.
Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry. Did you stay long?
I was there for 4 days.  I wanted to see Cinderella but I kept missing her.
Maybe she was around_comma_ but it wasn't time for the ball yet.
Haha_comma_ maybe I didn't think of that!
I have a special dinner arranged for me and my husband this week.
That's wonderful. He'll be so excited when he finds out!
Yes he will it's his birthday and we can have a night alone no kids just a nice dinner.
I hope you guys have a great time. Just the two of you.
We will thank you.
I went to my first official concert last month I was so amazed it was a surprise to even go there.
Concerts can be a lot of fun! Will you be going to another one?
Yes if they can outdo Queen Bey lol we saw Beyonce and she put on a awesome show a night to remember.
I've never been to a Beyonce concert. Always sold out! I'm glad you got to see her.
I am really pleased with my job performance lately. I will be getting that promotion for sure.
Congratulations! Good to hear your hard work is paying off.
Yes i am delighted and kinda proud of myself.  I have worked very hard.
You should definitely be proud of yourself. Pat yourself on the back.
Thanks! It feels good to be productive.
I have put in so many hours at work hoping to get a promotion. Fingers crossed it works
Yeah I hope you get it! I'm sure they will recognize the extra time you've been doing.
i really hope so. I have worked 60+ hours a week for the last 6 months.
Wow_comma_ I hope you're getting paid for all that extra time!
I am salary unfortunately. But_comma_ if i get this new promotion_comma_ it will be worth it.  Lots more money.
My girlfriend moved some of our mutual money without letting me know
Sorry to hear that my friend.. Was she facing an emergency?
Not really. I dont know what she used it for_comma_ she has not told anything to me so far
I know it sucks_comma_ but i think you should have an open conversation to your girl about this
im so mad! I can't find my hair brush!
That is a tragedy! Where do you think you left it? Did you check your pockets?
i have checked everywhere.  i think my dog may have snatched it.
Interesting. I hope you do find it. I don't know how you brush your hair.
i am not brushing it_comma_ and it looks a mess.
my husband has been texting a woman he works with
How does that make you feel?
very very bad_comma_ and suspicious.
I am so sorry to hear you're going through this. Hopefully_comma_ it's nothing.
hopefully.  I have not read the texts_comma_ but seen the name pop up.
I want to see all the ingredients on the table before i start to cook
Oh_comma_ so you always prepare well huh?
Yeah_comma_ i am one of those people who want to know everything is set before starting something
I always wanted that level of discipline. good for you :)
i am so happy that i am going to be a grandma
Congratulations! boy or girl
we don't know yet_comma_ she is only a few months along
well_comma_ as long as its a happy healthy baby you guys will be fine
yes that is all i want really
Yep. Happy and healthy is a blessing
i am not going to be able to see my favorite band when they come to town
What's the band?
def leppard.  they are going to be with reo speedwagon and tesla too.
Wow. That must suck. Do you like the band incubus? I missed them a couple of times but I saw them this year
i do_comma_ they did a song called wish you were here that i loved.
yes. I wish I could send you a clip of it from the concert. It was awesome. Maybe you could catch def leppard next time.
I went to a comic book convention last month
That sounds really cool.
Yeah. i felt like i was a child again_comma_ standing amidst all those superheroes
Oh_comma_ such great nostalgia.
i caught my husband looking at another woman
oof that sucks.
yes.  i wasn't too happy about it.
yea you shouldnt be
i questioned him about it and he denied it.  but i caught him red handed.
well hopefully you find a better path in life
I am really looking forward to this season of the Lakers_comma_ with Lebron coming in
Oh wow_comma_ i did not even know about the transfer. I bet Laker fans are delighted
They are on cloud 9! With such a legend on their team_comma_ who wouldn't be_comma_ right?
So true. I might become a lakers fan myself at this point
im feeling blue because my days and nights are mixed up
That really sucks. Have you tried taking some melatonin?
i have tried taking benadryl and some other sleep aid.  i should try melatonin.
Yeah_comma_ it works wonders for me when I can't sleep.
I felt really lonely when my dog tom passed away last month
Oh god.. so sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did Tom pass?
He was old. He was my childhood dog and he was always with me all the time
I can feel your emotions. Find peace in knowing that Tom is at a better place now
i am so thankful for my family. they are the best!
Why are you so thankful? Is it Thanksgiving?
they are very good to me. they are always there for me.
That's great to hear. It's always good to have a great family support structure when times are hard.
I was so angry when my brother played a prank by tying a firecracker on our dog's tail
Oh no_comma_ that is a terrible thing to do.
Yeah.. He always plays pranks_comma_ but this one made me furious. I went to him and gave him a punch so that he learns to respect animals
I applaud your response.
my cat vomited in the floor and i stepped in it!
Oh no!!!  Did it smell bad?
no just really gross_comma_ all warm and mushy between my toes.
Ewwwww!  Hope the cat is okay!
I am ready for school to start! I can't wait to teach my first class.
Sounds exciting.  I wish you the best of luck!
Thank you! I am a little nervous_comma_ but I am sure everything will be great.
Don't worry everyone is nervous on the first day.
I was furious when my brother lit a firecracker tying it to our dog's tail

I gave him a punch right away. thats no way to treat animals.
i am so glad that you did
i am sad that i won't be able to buy a new car.

memories of my dog break my heart.. she passed away last month
Im sorry to hear that
thanks.. She was old_comma_ but still_comma_ i feel so alone without her
Was she really sick?
I ate eggplant for the first time_comma_ and I hated it
Eggplant is gross but hey now you know! lol
Yes! It was so awful_comma_ I can't see how people eat it.
I can't either!  I tried it once and I'm like you......NO MORE!
i was so mad when i saw my brother lighting up a firecracker tying it to my dog's tail
That's so messed up! Why was he doing that?
He plays pranks_comma_ but this was way over the line! i went to him and threw a punch at him. i dont think he will be doing that anymore
Good to hear_comma_ how old was he?
i can't wait to see the next avengers movie!!
ME too. Marvel movies are the best. Im late I just saw wonderwomAN

i was so heartbroken when my dog died last month
That's so sad! Did he at least die of old age?
he was hit by a truck.. i cant even imagine it
I'm so sorry to hear that_comma_ may he rest in peace.
i want to see all the ingredients neatly lined up on the table before i start cooking
Is that because you just like being organized?
Yes_comma_ i want to be prepared all this time_comma_ it is just the way i am
That is really a good way to be. I need to practice this more_comma_ myself!
i am pretty comfy right now in my bed. i feel very relaxed.
Bed is always a source of comfort for me. Especially_comma_ after work when I feel so drained and stressed out
Yes that is the best time.  I like to come home_comma_ fix some food_comma_ and dive into my bed.  It is such a comfort.
Indeed. Particularly_comma_ when i grab my phone and watch short clips from my favorite TV shows on Youtube
i was feeling so alone in florida when i moved there
aw I'm sorry to hear.  Did you conquer your loneliness?
i did. i had gotten a new job there_comma_ and it was my first time being away from my family
I'm glad you were able to adjust.  It can be lonely without family around.
I am scared that I won't be able to get up tomorrow morning
oh no.. why are you feeling that way?
i have to get up at 8 am_comma_ and it's already 4.
That sucks.. Are you having trouble falling asleep?
i saw angeline jolie the other day
How did that go exactly?
I saw her coming out of a restaurant. She still looks so gorgeous_comma_ such a timeless beauty!
She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.
i was so grossed out when a friend threw up on me
i dont blame you! i would have also!
we were at a party and he had too much whiskey inside him.
nasty! did you tell him anything?
i was so mad when i found out our dogwalker used to torchur my dog
Oh wow! I am so sorry that happened to you.
Thanks.. i fired her right then and there
I would have called the cops on her!
i once saw a man lift a car all by himself!
What type of car was it?
it was a fiat
That must have been a very big man.
Surprisingly he wasn't that big. Just powerful
i found 100 dollars in an old coat I had in storage!
thats so nice_comma_ love when that happens
yes it was definitely great_comma_ and couldn't have come at a better time.
that nice_comma_ good for you
I would love to buy a travel trailer_comma_ but I'm not sure if it would be a good idea.
oh yea whys that?
i have heard they aren't good quality. They have lots of problems.
oh that makes a lot of sense
I am going to have a great day today! I feel good and I am standing tall
What do you plan on doing today?
I plan on going out and conquering the world! I feel like a million bucks.
I want some of whatever you had for breakfast. You seem very happy.
I am frightened that i will lose my job.
Sorry to hear that! Why do you think that might happen?
They have been laying people off_comma_ and the last person started a week after i didn
Hopefully that doesn't happen_comma_ and you have job security.
I sat in something wet and didn't know it. Walked around all day with a wet rear.
That's pretty embarrassing haha. Ever find out what it was?
I still don't know. I'm sure it was pop or coffee.
That would make sense_comma_ though you could probably have smelt it if it was coffee.
I am so upset! My phone was on top of my car and it fell off and shattered
Oh damn that's so sad. Was it salvageable?
Nope_comma_ completely destroyed. I will have to buy a new one. So inconvenient.
It definitely sounds that way_comma_ gonna upgrade it?
my son had his wisdom teeth removed_comma_ and i took the opportunity to baby him a bit. he is 24
oh yea i had those out 2 years ago it sucks
yes he was pretty pitiful.  funny at first_comma_ but then he started hurting. i felt bad for him.
yea it can be sore and you cant eat anything
I wish i could see my father one more time
im glad i still have mine around.
spend as much time as you can with him. you never know when you won't be able to anymore.
exactly what i do. we were never close growig up. we are now.
i miss watching chiller theatre with my family on fridays
Wow_comma_ what is chiller theatre? I'm intrigued.
it was a show that came on at midnight that would play scary movies. first 3d movie i ever saw was on the show. got the 3d glasses free with a pizza. lol
Must be fun but unnerving as well. Whats your favourite horror movie?
Hi I just wanted to tell you about a special thing that happend to me
What happened to you?
I was at work one day and I came home and some special people were there
Your best friends?
nope my grandparents were in town
I ate too many sweets the other day_comma_ they were so good though.
really what kind of sweets did you eat?
I don't remember the name_comma_ but they looked like regular cookies.
I love cookies especially oreo's they are my favorite
You know when I was a kid we took a lot of fun vacations
That is nice to have good memories.
yeah I remember going to fun places like Busch Gardens and riding on coasters
Did you go with your cousins?
It was hard for my brother through out school
Why is that
he really was motivated in highsool  high school
I was too
yes but i kept pushing and pushing and he graduated!
Hello did you ever get to go to Disney when you were young?
No_comma_ I don't get any golden opportunity. did you  ?
No we were poor growing up and it always made me sad that we didn't have the opportunity to go
Don't worry. Earn for it and go!!
We had record rainfall in my town this past spring causing a lot of flooding.
Oh no. Floodwaters can be devastating. Was there a lot of damage?
Yes_comma_ there was_comma_ the town was very damaged. We had sandbagged around our home and managed to save our house.
Good thing you were prepared.
I got into a argument with a coworker of mine this past month.
Did yall make up
No_comma_  he had taken credit for my work with our boss.
That is not good
I had a big fishing trip planned for this past weekend_comma_ but it got rained out.
Will you get to make it up?
Doesn't seem like it. My job makes it very difficult to schedule time off.
I am sure you will find time
A friend of mine got to try out for a professional baseball team.
Oh wow_comma_ how did he do
He made their minor league team_comma_ and if he does well_comma_ maybe the pro team.
That is so cool
Last week I had a big presentation at work_comma_ which I knew I was going to do well on.
That sounds like something that could really show off your talents.
I sure did_comma_ I had spent weeks learning the material_comma_ and really impressed my boss.
That's great! Hope your hard work pays off.
I went to comic-con this year.. i felt like i was a child all over again
How expensive is that to go to?
Depends on where you live. I spent 1000 bucks on it
That is not too bad if you had a good time though
I felt so alone after my dog trevor passed last year
The loss of a pet is heartbreaking. I know how you feel. How old was Trevor.
He was 9.. his time hadn't come_comma_ but i guess life is that way sometimes..
Life is hard. But remember he didn't die he went to his forever home.
I was feeling so lonely in miami after i moved there
Sorry to hear that.  Have you since been able to overcome your loneliness?
I think so.. i have made some friends. it was my first time being away from family
I understand feeling like a duck out of the pond.  Glad to hear you've made progress.
I feel so nervous about my upcoming job interview
Don't feel nervous_comma_ you need to be confident!
I know.. but i have this feeling inside me that i would screw up
It's hard to push that feeling away sometimes_comma_ I know.
I am so hyped about Lebron  joining the Lakers!
That's exciting! I'm guessing you're a Lakers fan?
Yeah i am! We finally have something that unite and rally us behind our team for a season
What team was he on before?
I am feeling so nervous about my dad getting his heart checked tomorrow
I understand that_comma_ I will pray for you
Thank you so much.. I am just hoping not to get any bad news
That makes sense_comma_ I wish you both the best of luck and health!
When i look at my son doing great in studies_comma_ it makes me so proud!
How old is he?
He is 13. He has been a straight A student always.
Wow_comma_ great job so far_comma_ kep up the great parenting!
I went to watch the Annabelle movie in the theatres. It was a terrifying experience
Wasn't that out a long time ago? It must've been super scary if you still remember it.
Yeah_comma_ it has been a while. I went at night_comma_ alone. So you can imagine the impact!
Wow_comma_ I wouldn't have been brave enough to do that!
I always feel a bit of jealousy when i see someone driving around in a red sports car
Yes_comma_ it is hard to see people with things you can't afford to buy for yourself.
I feel that way about red sports car only though. I have always dreamed of owning one as a kid.
Yes_comma_ I like the color red as well. I have actually own a couple red sports cars.
I just took the last of my college finals and I stayed up all night studying the material.
It is great to be thorough and prepared. Are you expecting to perform well?
I know I did well_comma_ I had the material all memorized and knew the answers to all the questions.
Thats nice_comma_ i wish you the very best for your results!
I was super irritated when my boss kept pulling my hair for fun!
I can see why! That's highly inappropriate.
He seems to think otherwise for some reason. I am thinking about reporting him to the HR.
You should. He is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you
I am going out to dinner with my wife to a place we haven't been to since I proposed to her. I cant wait.
Oh wow_comma_ that is going to be such a sweet experience!
I hope so. It ended up being the best restaurant we ever went to and it will be nice to rekindle out early romance.
That is very true. I sincerely wish you both to have a wonderful time!
thank you_comma_ we plan on it.
I always feel down and blue when memories of my mom come in my mind.. she passed when i was 12
I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have things of hers that remind you of her often?
Yeah.. i have kept a collection of her things_comma_ just so that she always stays in my life.
That is beautiful that you have those things of hers. Mothers are very special people.
I was so excited to go to Flower & Garden Festival at Epcot this year. I couldn't wait to try all the food and see the beautiful gardening.
I have been to that_comma_ it is such a wonderful experience. You are going to love it!
I absolutely love going to Disney and the festivals at Epcot are such a great experience each time. We go to Food & Wine each year and the seminars are my favorite part! It's so exciting!
You seem to have a great taste in spending your free time. I wish you get to have a splendid time in there!
I was heartbroken when my dog trevor died last month..
I'm sorry to hear about that. How did he die?
He was ran over by a truck.. I can't even try to imagine that
yeah I bet. Im sorry for your loss
I hurt my back and can't mow the grass so it's getting long and everyone elses lawn look so nice. It's embarrassing.
How did you hurt your back?
I really don't know. I woke up at it was tight then it just kept getting worse as day went on. Its been a week now.
Ohh wow! I hope it gets better for you
Me too. My lawn looks horrible and people are starting to think I don't take care of my home i bet.
A friend of mine borrowed my mower this past weekend_comma_ which he brought back broken.
Did you ask him to replace it?
He said it wasn't his fault and it just stopped working. Of course the blade is bent_comma_ so I think he might be lying.
I agree with you there_comma_ I would ask him to pay honestly
My local animal shelter donated a dog to me because of my service connected disability. It was such a nice surprise
That's nice. How  do you like the dog?
He is my best friend and I think he needs me as much as I need him.
That is so sweet. My apartments don't allow pets
I love when I go somewhere and for some reason or another it reminds me of my childhood. It makes me feel so good.
That is for sure_comma_ especially a smell that just throws you back
OMG yes! Sometimes it's a sound or just a feeling you get for no reason. It's like comfort food .lol
Exactly_comma_ sometimes I just smell a good barbeque and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid_comma_ life is great sometimes
I was suppose to go on vacation with my family last month_comma_ but I caught the flu and couldn't go.
That stinks. Im sorry to hear that
Yeah_comma_ I was looking forward to sitting on the beach and relaxing.
I bet! It seems like fun
I am celebrating me and my wife's 5 year anniversary tomorrow and I'm excited about it.
Congratulations. Fun plans?
Just going out to dinner and then a romantic night at the beach.
Awww. I'm jealous lol
Years ago when we moved into our home_comma_ we found a young kitten that had been abandoned.
Awww. Did you keep it?
Yes_comma_ we did. He was so cute we took him in_comma_ and now he is 9 years old.
Thats great. I know he appreciates it
I feel very ready for my college exam.
That's great. I hope you do well!
Thank you. I think it will be easy!
Good luck!
My rabbit died last year_comma_ I miss her to this day
how old was it
I had her for about 10 years.
they live that long ? interesting
Yeah_comma_ they can live to about 14 years if you take care of them right
So I asked my boss for a raise today.
How'd that go?
It went well_comma_ I'm pretty sure that I'll get it!
Well congratulations! That must have been nerve-wracking.
So my neighbor just bought a new car. I swear_comma_ he always gets really expensive stuff to show off how successful he is.
That stinks. Maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve
Maybe... but still. Now I feel like I need to buy one myself.
Do it! I bet you deserve it
Last year my wife got into an accident and we only had one car and I was so worried we wouldn't have a car to get to work
Did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?
We didn't have many options but the other persons insurance ended up taking care of it all so we got a rental and the car got fixed but i was so scared .
Well I am glad it worked out
Last night I found something in my son's room that made me so mad!
What did you find?!
Drugs! I found drugs. I can't believe this.
Oh no_comma_ are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs?
I definitely will. I bet he'll say that they aren't his_comma_ but I know better.
Do you remember that show I was telling you about the other day? It's getting a new season!
Remind me_comma_ which show was that?
The one with the three cops that can never agree with each other but end up solving the cases anyway. I'm so happy about this news!
That's so cool!  I'm gonna have to check it out
I was going through some boxes today_comma_ and I found a really old picture of me with my grandmother.
That's nice. Are you going to hang it up?
Yeah_comma_ definitely. It brings back really good memories.
Great_comma_ you've found an old treasure.
My girlfriend broke up with me recently...
I'm sorry. How long had you been together?
We were together for 3 years. I can't stand being alone.
Just try and get through each day_comma_ one at a time. Don't think too far ahead.
I keep hearing noises coming from my basement...
That sounds scary.  Are you going to investigate?
I want to_comma_ but I'm a bit scared. Maybe I should take something with me to defend myself_comma_ just in case.
If this were a movie_comma_ I'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.
I can't believe this! My son failed a really important test.
I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he planning to retake the test?
I sure hope so. Otherwise he might not be able to graduate.
What test?
It was a math test_comma_ it makes up a pretty large part of his grade.
They other day was my son's first day of school_comma_ and when I dropped him off it brought back so much memories.
That's great. Is that your only son?
Yes_comma_ he's my only son. I cant wait until he get's his first girlfriend like I did in middle school. Those were the days.
I'm sure the memories will be great
So I've been walking around all day with a huge hole in the back of my pants... I just found out about it.
Oh wow! Hopefully no one saw it
If they did_comma_ no one told me about it! So embarrassing.
Im sorry about that. Ive gone through that before. Laughter can be good medicine sometimes
So that new game that I've been looking forward to is coming out in a few weeks!
What is it called ?
Oh_comma_ I'm sure it's not one that you've heard of. I'm pretty excited though_comma_ I've been saving up money for it for a few months now.
Okay_comma_ well I guess I'm happy for you then.
Yesterday_comma_ I caught my neighbor letting his dog poop on my lawn. I had a few choice words for him.
That's understandable.  How receptive was he to your complaint?
He wasn't to happy about me confronting him. I told him if it happens again it might get physical.
Oh_comma_ so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries.
I was going through some boxes in my attic today.
Did you find anything?
Yeah_comma_ I found some old toys from my childhood. So many memories came flooding back into my mind.
I bet that was very nostalgic for you.
I can't believe that my coworker got the promotion that I was going for. This is ridiculous.
That's a hard hit to take.  Why do you suspect they got it?
I honestly have no idea. I was definitely more deserving of that position.
So what are you going to do about?  Are you going to start looking for another place to work?
I really think that I might.
I'm so ashamed of myself. I made a big mistake on a project for work.
What did you mess up?
It was something for an important client. Now I'm afraid this is going to screw up my career.
I'm sure you'll be fine.  Have you made many similar mistakes in the past?
No_comma_ this is the first time I've messed up anything like this.
I wouldn't worry too much about it then.  Don't let it get you down.
I bought a used car a few years ago and found 500 dollars tucked in the back seat!
Wow_comma_ that's nice. I hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!
Oh I spent it on a few things. I was just surprised someone didn't find it when it was being cleaned.
I guess they didn't do as good a job as they should have_comma_ lol. Wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!
I know! made it not so bad that the car I traded in was a junker and not worth much lol
Well_comma_ it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'.
I'm going camping with my kids this weekend.
How fun! In a tent or an RV?
In a tent. I just have to make extra sure that I pack all of the supplies that we'll need.
Don't forget a first aid kit! We always need those on camping trips!
On my way home today there was someone in the fast lane going so slow in front of me.
Ugh_comma_ that's so annoying.  How long did you have to follow behind them?
about 5 miles. there was too much trafic in the slow lane_comma_ couldn't get over
I hope you weren't late for anything important!
I was watching television earlier today when I came across a channel that was showing a bunch of cartoons that I loved when I was younger.
memory lane right there! which cartoons?
It was a whole bunch of different ones from the 90's. Man_comma_ they really reminded me of my childhood.
Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.
I keep getting strange phone calls. It's creeping me out.
That would creep me out too what kind of calls??
The person on the other end just keeps making really weird sounds until I hang up. I'm not sure what I should do about it.
Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird.
My boyfriend told me he quit drinking_comma_ but I just found a bunch of empty liquor bottles he hid in his room.
Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?
Absolutely_comma_ but it probably won't go well. He needs help but he won't accept it.
Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.
Yay! I'm finally getting a promotion at work!
Congratulations_comma_ that's awesome! I hope you're getting a raise too!
Yeah_comma_ a raise will definitely come with it. I've put a lot of work into this_comma_ and it finally paid off!
Hope you treat yourself to celebrate_comma_ you deserve it!
So I might be up for a promotion soon at work!
That sounds amazing! When will you find out?
Soon. There are several other people trying to get the same position_comma_ but I'm pretty hopeful that things will work out in my favor.
You sound positive so I am sure you will get it!!!
We went to get gas one night and my husband and an altercation with some guy_comma_ guy pulledoutabig knife in the storeand by our car at the gas station.
omg_comma_ that's so scary! are you okay? did you call the police?
yes we called the police he was arrested!
that's good to hear! people are crazy
really crazy had to go to court_comma_ he lied so much
i envy my friend who is off work today
I bet.  It is nice to have a day off every now and then
it definitely is
I like having days off to do absolutly nothing.  It helps with stress.
Ugh_comma_ my cat keeps climbing up the curtains in my room.
That's the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much?
Yeah_comma_ he's tearing them up. I really wish he'd stop.
Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?
I'm not sure_comma_ but I'm going to try to find something that will do that.
We've decided to adopt another cat from the shelter!
That is great! Adopt_comma_ don't shop! Always a great motto!
Agreed_comma_ that's my motto! This is a high-kill shelter too_comma_ so we'll definitely be saving a life :)
That is great_comma_ I commend you!
i am nervous for a meeting i have later
Have you prepared enough for it?
yeah i believe so
Well Im sure you be fine. Just relax.
im happy with my health for the first time in a few years
That's good to hear! Have you been eating healthy?
yes definitely_comma_ and getting plenty of exercise
That's great! Keep up the good work!
I bought some new food for my dog_comma_ and he refuses to eat it.
thats strange_comma_ my dog will eat anything lol
Yeah_comma_ that's what I thought about mine too. I bought a huge bag of the stuff_comma_ too. It's so irritating.
maybe he will start warming up to it soon
I certainly hope so.
My coworker gave a really nice presentation at work today.
About what?!
Oh it was just boring work stuff_comma_ about a client. But I was really awed by the amount of work that she put into it.
That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.
I've been working hard and doing a great job for several months_comma_ but still no raise.
thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return
Yeah_comma_ especially when my boss promised to pay me more. Might be time to quit!
Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier!
im nervous about taking a test soon
Did you study for it or are you winging it?
i feel pretty prepared
Don't worry then.  You did you part!! I'm sure you will do fine!
My roommate is gone for the week_comma_ on a business trip. It's way too quiet around here.
Maybe you should try and have a party?
That's a good idea. I can't stand being alone in this place much longer.
Yes being alone is not very fun.
My birthday is coming up next week. I'm really looking forward to it.
What will your new age be?
I'll be turning 35. And some friends are coming that I haven't seen in years_comma_ it'll be great to see them again.
You should have a great time_comma_ congrats on the new age!
My wife and I got a divorce. The house is so quiet without her and the kids being here.
I went through a similar thing a few years back.  Everything seemed hollow to me.  How long has it been?
About two years now and everything still seems very odd to me.
If your depressed_comma_ speak to someone.  If it's just adjusting to the change_comma_ that comes in time.
Uh oh. I'm in trouble now.
Why is it that you are in trouble?
I lost a really important document at work... telling my boss is going to be so embarrassing.
Can you just replace the document?
If only it were that easy. It had several signatures on it.
There's a creepy guy that comes by at work that won't stop bothering me. He writes crazy letters_comma_ and keeps calling on the phone "just to chat" with me.
I would be reporting that to the police for sure.
I tried. They said they can't do anything unless he actually tries to physically harm me_comma_ which is insane to me.
Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane.
My father was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer.
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.
Yes it was. It only took a few short months and my father passed away due to it being inoperable.
I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.
I'm starting a new job next week! Can't wait to be doing something different for a change!
That's great. What will you be doing at your new job?
Thanks! Graphic design mostly. At my old job I was a manager and it was horrible.
Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place_comma_ you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything.
Recently_comma_ I got passed over for a promotion at my job.
Aw man_comma_ that sucks. Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?
No_comma_ the guy that got it was qualified_comma_ it's just I really wanted the job. It would have really help my career.
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!
I bought a scratch off lottery ticket the other day_comma_ and won $5000.
That is amazingly lucky! good for you!
I almost passed out_comma_ I have never won so much money before.
That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!
Had to take my cat to the vet. He's got a bad injury on his paw and it hasn't been healing.
Awh poor baby.. I am sure itll get better now tho! How old is he?
He's 8 years old. They're going to have to put him down - turns out he has feline aids :(
Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry. :(
One of my art pieces has been chosen to be put in a exhibition!
I would be so excited! Did they pay you for it?
Haven't been paid for it yet_comma_ but people that visit are welcome to put in an offer for anything they see! Fingers crossed someone wants mine!
Hopefully! that would be so amazing!
I was enjoying the morning watching the kids play in the pool.
That sounds like such a fun_comma_ peaceful morning. So jealous you have a pool_comma_ it's been scorching outside!
Well it's only a kiddie pool_comma_ kids are very little. It was a very nice morning.
Ah okay_comma_ nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast_comma_ so hold onto these moments while you can:)
As a child_comma_ I was mean to my sister all the time and I still feel awful about it.
Aw_comma_ well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.
True_comma_ but she's very sensitive. I'm sure it still bothers her. I try to make up for it today_comma_ but I never can take those things back.
Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.
my husband and i lostour daughter 2years ago and i don't care to celebrate mother's day and he still impressed me with a gift
I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?
he got my favorite flower_comma_ an orchid a card and made dinner
That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.
thanks
Went to get an oil change the other day. Turns out I didn't need one for another 1_comma_000 miles_comma_ and I felt like such a fool.
Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself.
Agreed_comma_ and it had been 5 months so I figured I was due. The mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing!
Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol
My cat somehow managed to lock himself in the bathroom last night. I still can't figure out how he did it.
Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?
He is! Well_comma_ both smart and dumb haha. Had to use a knitting needle to pick the lock!
Well at least you managed to save him!
I've got a coworker with zero social skills_comma_ and it's driving me batty. She can't seem to tell no one wants to listen to her talk for 30 minutes straight.
Oh man_comma_ I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?
If you make a comment on anything_comma_ say cats_comma_ she'll go into a monologue about everything she's ever learned about a cat (most of it wrong).
That's the worst! Some people_comma_ once they get started_comma_ they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.
We had an annoying client the other day_comma_ and I went to the breakroom to complain about her to my coworkers (thinking she couldn't hear).
Did it feel good to get it out?
It did at first_comma_ until I left the room and saw she was sitting right by the door where she could hear everything! It was humiliating and I felt really bad for her after that.
Oh no_comma_ that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?
I found some baby kittens in my yard_comma_ their mother was dead. I nursed them to health and found homes for them.
That's heartbreaking_comma_ but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.
They are my favorite_comma_ too. I love how independent they are.
Yes_comma_ and when they love you it feels special_comma_ because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!
Finances aren't great right now. I've got a lot of bills that are overdue_comma_ but I can't afford to pay them :(
I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.
I'm sorry we're both in this situation. It really sucks_comma_ and it feels unfair because it's not for lack of effort.
Yeah_comma_ that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out_comma_ maybe it'll change.
I was out of school for over a year and thought i forgot everything before taking this big test
You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!
I know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off
Im glad it paid off for you_comma_ you must be super proud!
A few years back I got laid off from my job because they were losing too much money. It broke me_comma_ I really loved that job.
Oh no_comma_ I am so sorry. What did you do?
To be honest_comma_ I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.
That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?
I did_comma_ yeah. And strangely enough_comma_ the company hired me back a few years later when they were doing better cashflow-wise.
im stoked to go see some old friends tomorrow night
Good_comma_ how long has it been since you saw them last?
about a year and a half!
I hope you all have some fun.
I'm SO ready for fall - it's been incredibly hot all summer_comma_ and I need my favorite season to hurry up & get here!
Oh yes_comma_ fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!
Me too! Wearing comfy sweaters_comma_ snuggling up with a hot drink_comma_ and fall smell on the air...can't wait for it!
It is the best season_comma_ by far! Plus_comma_ Halloween!
A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross.
Oh man_comma_ those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar_comma_ a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.
Thanks for the tip_comma_ I will try that! I cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away. I have no idea where they go but don't really care either as long as they're gone!
Seriously_comma_ gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!
I'm getting married next year! Hoping everything goes smoothly and we get the wedding we want to have.
That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.
Boy are you right about that. I was really excited during the early planning stages_comma_ but it's been stressful ever since.
It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.
My friends went ahead and gave me a baby shower that I didn't know about.
oh that was nice of them
Yeah_comma_ they had told my husband about it so he could get me there.
haha thats pretty fun
I have an adorable hamster that doesn't look like he's doing well. He is on the old side for hamsters_comma_ and I'm worried he won't live much longer.
Oh no_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?
Thank you_comma_ me too! He's a little over 2 years old. I'd hate to lose him_comma_ but they usually don't live more than 2-3 years.
Oh I see_comma_ I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!
I went back to work for my former company recently. They laid me off a few years ago when things were tough. Coming back was a little scary but I was thrilled!
That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!
Yes_comma_ that's exactly how I felt. I suspected they'd been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good.
I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!
Thank you!
im upset that my neighbor's dog is sick
That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?
no they are at the vet now
Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?
Well i had spent the good part of a week organising the best weekend away with my hubby for our 10th wedding anniversary. Spa day_comma_ great dinner_comma_ concert and of course the parents were booked to mind the kids for the weekend.  However all did not go to plan...
Oh no_comma_ what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!

My neighbor has a brand new Tesla and every time I look at it I get so envious. I know it's stupid_comma_ I should be happy for him that he has such a cool car.
Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?
Well that's the thing_comma_ I don't. I bike everywhere. Don't get me wrong_comma_ I love my bike and it's a great way to stay fit.
You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.
That is a really good way to put it_comma_ I will definitely keep that in mind next time I find myself pining after his car.
lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla_comma_ if you feel like it!
A Tesla with a bike rack!
Exactly!
I'm happy my package just arrived
oh thats nice
im glad it came earlier
yea i would be to
I'm feeling nostalgic today
Why's that?
I found some old keepsakes in the basement ealier
Nostalgia is a weird feeling.
I've got a fun weekend coming up_comma_ and I'm really looking forward to it!
Nice_comma_ what do you have planned?
Going to the drive-in_comma_ out to eat_comma_ and probably minigolf. Nothing particularly special_comma_ just haven't had fun in awhile!
Sound great_comma_ I'm happy for you!
I recently had a project of mine recognized in a national publication!
Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!
It felt amazing to be recognized for my work_comma_ and in a publication I respect to boot!
Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.
Well I certainly wasn't expecting it so who knows_comma_ maybe one day you will!
I am going to Disney next year. I want to write a list of everything to bring.
What are some things you will bring?
I'm not really sure. I think if I write things out that I could possibly need I won't forget anything.
It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.
Things have been rough for me lately_comma_ but thankfully I've got family and a fiance that are helping me through it.
What is wrong? Are you okay?
I'm in a lot of debt thanks to my car needing expensive repairs_comma_ and haven't been able to afford it. It's pretty depressing not being able to pay your bills :/
I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.
the rain today is frustrating
We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.
im not a fan of it at all
Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.
The other day I was riding my bike and this woman ran a stop sign_comma_ nearly hitting me. Thank goodness I was paying attention and was able to stop in time.
Oh my goodness_comma_ I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!
I wish people would pay more attention. I try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when I'm on my bike and in a car.
Ditto. It's not hard to do_comma_ and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!
Thank you_comma_ I appreciate that!
My boyfriend proposed to me_comma_ and I accepted! I thought he didn't want to get married so it was a welcome surprise.
Wow_comma_ congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?
Thank you! We're hoping to get married sometime next year_comma_ but man weddings are expensive. It may be further off than I'd like!
Oh I feel you_comma_ I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.
I just had my birthday and I ate WAY too much. Had a good time_comma_ but boy do I feel bad for all of that food. I'm supposed to be eating healthier!
I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.
No kidding. Had free refills on a root beer float too_comma_ and how could I say no to that?
Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.
i am pleased with the day im having today
Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.
me too but we wouldnt appreciate the good days if it werent for the bad
That is true. It puts things in context.
Every night before bed_comma_ we read the Bible to our son. I love when he relates what he learned to real life.
That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that.
It is. And shows that he is listening.
It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook.
Our mail carrier keeps leaving packages outside instead of putting them in the lobby.
that is frustrating_comma_ especially if the weather isnt ideal
Exactly! It rained the other day and my package was totally ruined.
that is unfortunate_comma_ im sorry that happened!
Thank you! At least I was able to get it replaced.
My friend left my front door open when she was house-sitting for me. My cat snuck out and was killed.
That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?
I was really upset at the time but once I had some time I realized it was an honest mistake. She felt really bad about it.
Are you going to get another cat?
When I'm ready_comma_ I think yes.
I can't wait for it to be Christmas already. Just thinking about that time of year makes me really happy.
I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!
Exactly! And the food_comma_ and friends. All of it is just so lovely.
I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!
Each day waking up I can't believe how lucky am I just to be alive.
That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.
Yes_comma_ I don't need anything. I have something to eat and a roof over my head. I really can't ask for anything more.
That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.
I went running for the first time in months. I could not believe it. I was able to run a full 8 miles with out taking a break.
8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!
Yes_comma_ my first time out in 60 days. I impressed my self.
Have you been a long time runner before that?
Not really. A few years ago I got tired of being fat so one day I just went out and started running. Two months ago I stopped due to hurting my back surfing. I got the all clear yesterday and went back out.
Just gave my wife access to my credit card. I'm worried but excited I can trust her. Do you ever have issues trusting people?
I can relate to that!  Yeah_comma_ my wife with my credit card_comma_ lol!
It's taken me 11 years to get to this point. Last time I let her have at it. She bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card.
Haha_comma_ I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?
It was fun. Adults only resort_comma_ all inclusive_comma_ private swimming pool off the room but cost 500 a day.
An extra 40k a year but it would be highly stressful. Currently I have the highest ratings in the USA_comma_ I'm sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well.
Oh wow_comma_ an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.
I currently work 50 hours a week. I'd be working around 75-80 a week then.
Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?
I took my wife surfing for the first time today. within an hour she was riding waves_comma_ Color me impressed!
Oh wow_comma_ I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!
Yes_comma_  I was surprised. I've been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly. She is not even athletic.
Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!
A friend of mine bought a new car
awesome! what kind?
Tesla_comma_ I've had my eye on the model for some time
oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat
A friend of mine got a new high paying job
That's good on his part_comma_ how do you feel about it?
I thought it was amazing he got it_comma_ seemed like a tough job to land
That's awesome_comma_ and I agree_comma_ the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.
A co-worker of mine was late delivering materials for a project
Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?
The guy just doesn't seem to care
That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.
Going to the doctor for the first time since 2001 tomorrow. I'm dreading telling the doctor how long it has been since my last visit.
It will be okay. It's always hard making that step_comma_ but it's good for your health to do it.
I'm only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going. I'm in perfect health. But still ashamed.
I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.
im scared of this big test tomorrow
Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!
yes i have_comma_ still nervous though
Good luck_comma_ I'm sure you will do fine!
My wife and I are on a diet together for the last month. We have been doing great but today on my way home from work I stopped for Ice cream and did not tell her.
Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that.
Yea I know. The real issues is that I want to stop again from more tomorrow.
It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while_comma_ but you can't give in. Be strong!
I just turned in my dissertation. I'm scared it will not pass and all my work toward my masters will be for nothing.
You only get to do it once?
Yes_comma_ you turn it in then go in front of a board of people. In my case 10 people. If they don't like it I can't go one to work on my PhD and will need to write another. This one has taken 2 years to write.
Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.
I finally got a raise at my job
Congrats!
I was pretty happy_comma_ it was long overdue
Was it more than expected?
The other day I was drinking and sent an email I shouldn't have. I felt so stupid when I woke up and realized what I'd done.
That has happened to me_comma_ but with texts though lol
Yeah I've done that_comma_ too. The funny thing is I'm usually pretty eloquent even when I'm drunk so I don't think the recipient even realized I was drunk when I wrote it.
Did you apologize?
No_comma_ when they responded I just played it off like I meant to send it. Everything turned out fine!
LOL
My car has been having issues lately
what's wrong with it?
Engine issues I think_comma_ not sure if the car will make it
can you fix it?
Got on the scale today. I've only been on a diet 2 weeks and I'm down 17 pounds.
That is great news. Have you also been working out?
Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.
Has it been easy or hard to do that?
Rough. I used to like Iced tea and now only drink black coffee or water. I miss flavor. Plus it's a lot of work cooking everything.
I took some candy a friend left out
did they notice it was missing?
Not yet_comma_ I plan on compensating my friend for what I took
well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.
I just realized today I have not been home to where my family is from in a little over 10 years.
Ohh wow! Are you excited?
No I'm not going. I don't have time and my family dose not talk to me. I just miss home.
Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though
The other day this creepy guy followed me around the store and chased me out to the parking lot. He just wouldn't take a hint.
That's very creepy_comma_ did he say anything to you?
Yeah that's what made it weird_comma_ it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.
Those are definitely the scary types_comma_ they don't recognize social cues at all.
I hope that's all it was and not that he had some bad motive.
A close friend said she was having problems with her knee
Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.
Hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it
Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!
A co-worker stole my lunch
I've never understood that_comma_ it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?
Not entirely sure_comma_ I marked my lunch so they knew it wasn't theirs
Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag_comma_ maybe they will leave it alone.
A friend of mine revealed a deep dark secret I told her in confidence to everyone.
What did you do?
I blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed I was. I didn't know what else to do.
You definitely can't be too careful these days
You're right. It makes me less likely to trust others in the future.
Every single time I go in the office bathroom someone comes in and needs something. If I don't go to the bathroom no one comes in all day.
how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?
Because I work in the same little office alone all day. Today I did not use the bathroom no one came in. yesterday I went twice and each time I went I had someone waiting on me when I got back to my desk.
ok
I discovered my cat peed on my bath mat when I got out of the shower today and the mat was wet.
Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality_comma_ and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.
It's funny you say that_comma_ I actually like that about cats. They are independent and not too needy_comma_ which sort of describes me! I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside.
Yeah_comma_ I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one_comma_ and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy_comma_ mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So_comma_ we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.
Here's hoping your cat grows on you_comma_ they have a funny ability to do so.
I got the courage to contact a potential client the other day and set a rate for my work that's higher than I usually charge.
Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!
Thanks! The work isn't terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them.
Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it.
That always makes it worth it to be honest!
Someone hit my car and fled the scene
What! First of all_comma_ are you alright?
Yeah_comma_ I'm fine_comma_ the car was parked
Oh_comma_ well that's something_comma_ at least. I can't believe people are such cowards_comma_ though.
m promoting two staff members on Sunday. They work hard and are great people.
That's great. Do they know?
They have no clue. They know I ask them to do more then others but are clueless. I'm excited for them and the also the stress load they will take off of me.
Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either
m running my first Marathon Sunday. I'm scared that maybe I did not train hard enough.
I have never run a marathon
No better time to try then now.
You can try your best and if you don't finish there is always the next one
I will not run If I can't finish. I'm stubborn I'll finish or kill over.
Well that's some sort of motivation lol
Just finished my Master's degree now time to take on a PhD
Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?
Astrophysics
Oh geeze_comma_ I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?
I have another 3-4 years then I'll go into teaching.
I start my last year of my Masters program Friday. I'm scared I feel like I'm all ready behind.
Have you tried to talk to your teacher?
No it's mostly I feel behind on my thesis. When I started they told us keep up or drop out. I should have known_comma_ it's one of the hardest schools to get into.
What school is this you are talking about?
Cornell University_comma_ after this year I transfer to Princeton for my PhD
I spent all summer getting ready to write my thesis. I can't wait to get time to start.
That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.
I need to get it over. I need to start paying back student loans. It's the last thing I need to do before I can get hired as a Ad Professor.
Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you_comma_ I have over $40_comma_000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!
I've been paying on mine and have 75 still to pay. Then I want a PhD so that will be another 50k
I love to be snuggled up with attention and time with my boyfriend when he doesn't I get sad and jealous.
I can understand that.
I know he has to spend time with others but I get envious I want every minute spent together I'm spoiled lol.
You must love him very much_comma_ that's good.
I do best feeling ever.
I'm at a new school and I won't have any friends
Aw_comma_ it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time
Yes_comma_ but how do I even talk to people I don't know?
The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!
I felt very great a few weeks ago when i helped an elderly women bag her groceries
that is really nice of you to do_comma_ not a lot of people help others like that anymore
Yeah thats true most people don't.  I love helping those in need it's a great feeling
same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help_comma_ i will most likely bring it to you
I can't believe I didn't get that promotion at work :(
Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more_comma_ or who has better connections_comma_ and not actual merit. If you're good_comma_ I'm sure you will get recognized at some point.
Agreed_comma_ it's a popularity contest!
Well_comma_ keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job_comma_ hopefully that will be enough.
My wife cheated on me! It's absurd!!
Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you
Thank you_comma_ what should I do about it?
I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds
I was very happy last week helping an elderly women bag her groceries
Did she say thank you?
Yes she did thank me
What a lovely woman_comma_ and you're lovely_comma_ too!
Ugh_comma_ my neighbor's dogs wouldn't stop barking this morning!
That's the worst! What did you do?
Well I'll tell you what I didn't do. I didn't go back to sleep_comma_ due to the noise. I think I'm going to have a word with him later.
That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!
Remember when we were young and could run through the fields of flowers? I miss it.
Yeah_comma_ those were better times. Brings back good memories.
Maybe we can relive such times through our children.
Well_comma_ maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.
I don't understand why people come to work to just not do their jobs I have a coworker like this.
Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?
We are on the same page I have to pick up their slack and it just irritates me to the upmost it's like just quit please or give me a raise for doing double work.
I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.
The desert was incredible! The taste! The look! The feel as I ate it!
sounds like you ate a delicious dessert_comma_ what did you eat?
It was chocolate ice cream dipped in crushed cookies_comma_ marshmallows_comma_ and chocolate sauce which had frozen to a crisp!
that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert
I think I'm going to move my mother into my house with us.
O? That's a brave and noble decision.
Yeah_comma_ she's been pretty sick lately. I want to make sure she's here where she can get all of the care that she needs.
That's hard but great of you to do_comma_ good luck.
I'm going shopping tomorrow_comma_ it'll be so much fun!
Where will you be shopping?
I think I'll go to Costco and Walmart.
Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?
I'm so sad_comma_ my avocado was moldy this morning!
hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing
It really is! :(
did you still eat it? or did you throw it away
My family is the best they through me a surprise birthday party.
That's nice of them! People stopped doing that for me once I got older. I miss them
I was amazed they even did that but very grateful I haven't had anything in a while also so you wasn't alone your family will do something and you will enjoy it.
Well_comma_ I'm happy for you :) It shows that they care
i was shocked when i found out my wife cheated on me
Thats horrible! Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?
Im not sure what should i do though ?
It depends_comma_ if you love her_comma_ you could try to work it out.  Or you could cheat on her too
My friend taught his dog some tricks. It's really fun to watch!
O yea? I
It's amazing how quickly the dog responds to the commands. My friend must really know what he's doing.
I'm trying to teach mine tricks myself* I think that's fun to watch!
I was taking an important test in one of my classes the other day... I'm ashamed to say that I cheated.
I've cheated on occasion. It's never right but it's easy. At least you're ashamed of it.
Yeah... I'm thinking about coming clean about it to my professor before he finds out on his own.
That's your decision to make_comma_ but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation.
My wife and I are going out to one of my favorite restaurants tonight.
That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion?
Not really_comma_ just felt like going out. I'm thinking about ordering something I haven't had before_comma_ but.... I don't know. I'm weird about trying new foods.
I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.
I bought a used car a couple months ago and I have to say it's holding up really well for a 6 year old car. It's like new.
you must be loving it
I am_comma_ You never know what shape a used car really is until you have it for a while.
true that_comma_ you cant be too sure until you use it
I have a performance review coming up at work in a couple of weeks.
Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?
Oh yeah. I'm pretty sure the review is going to go well. I might even get a raise!
Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self-esteem
I just got notice that my mortgage payment has gone up this year and i'm so mad about it.
Oh no! That has so happened to me before! It was only by a couple dollars a month but I SO needed those couple of dollars at the time. I would be MAAADDD
I am_comma_ it went up 20 dollars.
Call the bank and get it fixed ASAP! That's got to be so annoying for you!
I have to go over the paperwork_comma_ it may be because my insurance went up.
I don't play the lottery_comma_ ever_comma_ but a friend recently gave me a scratch off ticket.
I buy those like twice a year and never win.
I won $200!
Wow! That's awesome! What did you do with it?
I blew it on online video games_comma_ lol.
Hey_comma_ why not? It's unexpected money!
That is always the best kind.  I still won't be buying lottery tickets_comma_ lol.
Yeah I feel like you get lucky once then it's all downhill from there.
My girlfriend and I were at a party Friday night. I couldn't find her anywhere_comma_ and got worried.
Where was she?
In a spare bedroom with her ex_comma_ laying on the bed and kissing him.
Does she have a new ex now?
Worked out for the best_comma_ she was honestly a pain anyways.
She sure does. I am not putting up with that_comma_ lol.
I would not put up with it either
I love the rain.  It makes everything feel fresh.
i love when the rain his the soil in the open field _comma_ the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing
I agree.  It hasn't rained here in weeks.  I miss the raing.
im stoked to go to the park later today
I bet you are. What are you going to do?
take my dog to the park and meet up with some friends!
sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it
i felt bad about sleeping in today
Why is that
i fell behind on things i needed to get done
You will be alright buddy
i feel like a have accomplished a lot this summer
What have you done this year if you dont mind me asking?
ive gotten a lot of work done and spent time with friends and family
That is great_comma_ well there is still time to go this year!
i am happy about the beautiful weather today
I love it when it's nice out. Are you going to do something outside?
yes_comma_ im going to the park later this afternoon!
That sounds great. A nice long walk in perfect weather. There's hardly anything better.
My brother just bought a new car...
Are you excited for him or jealous? lol
Well_comma_ I can't help but feel like he only did it to make me feel inferior.
I feel you! I know its hard having siblings sometimes! Go buy a toy car and park it on top of his.
I got a threatening phone call... and now I'm scared.
Can you report the caller?
I should be able to. I recognized the voice_comma_ it's someone that I used to know.
Be sure to do it_comma_ otherwise they could keep harassing you
i have studied and i am ready to take my test soon
What class is it for?
chemistry
I never took chemistry. Do you feel prepared for the test?
yes!
i am thankful for my supportive family
That's great.  Have they always been as supportive as they are now
yes i have been very fortunate
nice.  what do you do for a living
I went out to the garden and there were a ton of mosquitoes_comma_ I couldn't even do any gardening.
Have you thought about spraying your garden?
I thought about it but they were coming from the grass around it and I'm worried the dog would get sick if I sprayed the grass
Perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try
Hopefully. there were so many I thought I was in a jungle.
i was shocked how nice the weather has been the past couple days
Same here_comma_ I'm in Texas.  Where are you located
in the midwest!
Nice! I used to live in St. Paul_comma_ MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here
I was mowing the lawn today and it started storming out of nowhere!
Were you able to get inside fast?
No. I was in the middle of the yard and it was sunny_comma_ next thing I know it's pouring down rain and I'm soaked.
Oh wow! That would be annoying!
im envious of my friends who are off work today
How did they get off work midweek?
thats just their normal schedule
That would be nice but not fun that you don't have the same days off.
We go on vacation once a year as a family.
where is your favorite place to go?
I just love going_comma_ when it gets closer to when we are leaving I look forward to it.
i can imagine_comma_ i hope you have a great time this year
My son starts kindergarten soon. He is my first one.
I remember when my first child started_comma_ I was a nervous wreck.
They sent out an email saying that he may end up with a substitute teacher until they hire someone.
So they don't even have teachers yet? Wow_comma_ that's crazy.
It is! And we are paying for the school_comma_ I'm not to happy.
I have no friends and I am lonely
Have you tried getting out and meeting new people?
No_comma_ it is difficult to meet people in my area because I like in a farm. I only talk to the animals
What about online friends?
Can you be my online friend?
My friends went to dinner without me
that would hurt my feelings. are you alright?
I'm fine_comma_ just disappointed mostly
i totally understand that. i'm sorry.
I woke up and my car had a flat tire
That sucks! Did you have a spare on you?
No_comma_ but I was able to get it towed easily enough
That is good to hear.
A co-worker was having issues finishing a project
That's understandable. What kind of project was it? Were you involved?
It was a major work project_comma_ I stepped in to help him
That's so generous of you. It's people like you that make the work week bearable!
I was really apprehensive about going to university at the age of 30.
That's okay_comma_ I'm 25 and still in college. How did it go for you?
It went pretty well! I got great grades and made friends despite the age difference.
That's awesome. I'm glad it worked out well for you. :)
Thank you! In the end I had no reason to worry about it.
Once I was stranded hours from home in a snowstorm. I ended up going to a stranger's house to wait it out
Oh wow. I would have been so scared. more of a stranger than the storm
Well_comma_ she was really nice and we had been waiting together in the snow for awhile_comma_ so I felt I could trust her.
Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there
I was looking at advertisements of my childhood toys recently and felt strangely overwhelmed with emotion.
Did the ads bring up good memories I hope?
Yes! Especially the ads for toys I haven't thought of in years_comma_ like Boglins.
I have absolutely no idea what Boglins are_comma_ but I'm sure they were awesome!
Once when I was a kid I got caught in a riptide with my sister. It was very scary!
Sounds frightening! Was this off the coast of a beach or something?
Yes_comma_ Martinique Beach in Nova Scotia. The currents are very strong.
That is one of my greatest fears. Did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape?
Yes that's right! I was a strong swimmer so we made it.
Great to hear that you made it out ok!
I suppose to be on a committed diet but I kind of cheated today.
Well_comma_ I can understand that. It's very hard to be on a very strict diet_comma_ without a break here and now!
It is my coworkers said they was going to Burger King and I couldn't resist I feel so bad and guilty.
Well_comma_ i am sure you are disappointed_comma_ but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated. It's hard_comma_ I know!

Awwww_comma_ I am so sorry. Have you thought about getting a new pup?
Thank you and yes but I want to give her time to heal hopefully by Christmas she will be a little better and open to it.
Starting a new job can be different on my first day last month I can say that was me.
Yea_comma_ a new job is useless pretty stressful.
I would say I was more nervous then anything I think the new setting was over whelming but a month later I feel a lot better now.
It will be ok in the end.
I had a car accident the other day!
Oh that is a real bummer. Were you hurt?

I was clearing out my attic recently and came accross an old suitcase stuffed full of all my childhood toys_comma_ medals_comma_ school reports_comma_ photos etc!
That must of been fun to go through.
It was brilliant.  My mum must have gathered it up over the years.  I spent hours going through it all.  it made me feel so nostalgic.  I think its a great idea though_comma_ I might start doing it for my kids.
That is cool. Is your mother still alive?
No sadly so i didnt even know it was there.  Was definitely a wonderful surprise to find it.
Man that was hard to deal with today.
What was?
I had a lull in work and the store was empty_comma_ and there was nobody in there for an hour.  I was about to go insane.
Really? Did you manage to cope?
First it was just boring then I started to actually get pretty lonely.  I saw if there was something I could read while I waited.
And was there?
Yeah there was a magazine or two.  I got by
Good
Oh. But you are still here...
My 19 year old cat died recently. I was devastated.

I had two at the time so I still have one cat now :)
You know I have a friend that has a very successful business that he started with only a few thousand dollars
Really_comma_ how did they do it?
They started an irrigation sprinkler business with just a few contracts and its blown up and now he's handling large companies
Amazing! Well done to him.
I figured out why my air conditioner wasn't working earlier. I was very pleased with myself.
Well done_comma_ at least you will sit in your room excited and relaxed now
Exactly. It was so dang hot today_comma_ too.
Heat wave is getting so terrible theses days. I even watched on CNN that the whole of New South Wales is experiencing a drought_comma_ so sad
I kept getting stuck behind an irritating man while grocery shopping yesterday. He was so loud and always in my aisle.
That sounds unfortunate. You must have been so annoyed with him!
I was! He had an uncanny knack of blocking me and taking up the whole width of the aisle.
People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!
When I see little homeless girls I feel like a father.
Do you have daughters of your own?
No I do not_comma_ and probably never will.
Why is that?
I was stuck in traffic the other day for so long_comma_ when it was supposed to be clear.
yea traffic sucks
Unless there is good music playing.

I've seen a kid beet up a dog once_comma_ it got me very angry.
That's terrible! Did the dog survive?
Yes_comma_ the dog turned out to be fine_comma_ kid said he was training he her to be stronger.
Maybe someone should train the kid to be stronger... by beating him up!
Sometimes I feel like I am really an alright person.
What I do is to write all the good things I did within the week_comma_ I think you should do the same
it's a good idea_comma_ but we should also write our mistakes_comma_ to not repeat them in the future.
i agree with you buddy
My last vacation we went to Florida and a lot of prep work went into getting everything ready

While I was eating dinner last week_comma_ my wife and I watched a guy pick up the rear end of a newer pick up truck.
He sounds pretty strong. Any reason in particular that he did that?
My guess would be because he was drunk. It was still quite the sight to see.
No kidding. Definitely some quality entertainment for dinner time!
So my wife and I after saving all year are going on our first vacation together next month.
That must be so exciting!
My wife is so happy. She has never seen the ocean before.

Last year during a bad storm_comma_ a tornado touched down right across the street from our house.

It was. We were in the basement and it sounded like a freight train was going over the house.
I'm glad that you are okay.
My family and I recently moved_comma_ and we found a box of our oldest child's baby toys from 12 years ago.
i bet that was quite the blast from the past
It was!  It was a bit bittersweet_comma_ though. They grow up too fast.
yes they do. mine are already out of college
We packed up everything in the car to go visit my family.
Oh_comma_ are you going on a trip?
We went on vacation to see my family in another state. I was very happy to be going.

Really?
Yeah.  It was great to get away from work and family pressures for just a bit_comma_ and to enjoy some peace and quiet.
That's fun
Last month_comma_ my cat Sam passed away. He was 14 years old.
Oh no! I'm so sorry! It's so difficult to lose a pet.
He was more than a pet_comma_ he was truly my best friend.

Last week_comma_ there was a front move through our area that produced many very powerful storms.

It really did. Also_comma_ there were over 20 confirmed tornado touch downs in my county alone.
That must be really scary to go through.
I was going to a pumpkin patch with my sister in law_comma_ and I let her drive my car.
That sounds like fun! What happened?
I wasn't feeling good so she drove_comma_ but she drives kind of fast. Usually I don't let anyone drive my car.
Yeah- I understand that. I don't let anyone drive my car_comma_ either. I hope everything worked out okay!
A stranger bought me groceries last Sunday. I only know them through an online forum.
That seems like it would be a little awkward to me..
They saw a post I'd made about losing my job and messaged me. I'm going to embroider them something as thanks.
Well_comma_ they sound like they are actually just a nice person trying to help you out_comma_ that is really nice.

I have a buddy who decided to take up playing guitar a few years ago.
That is nice. Did you start playing guitar with him?
I tried_comma_ lol.  I recently heard him play for the first time in over a year.  His skill levels astounds me.
That is good.
I work from home and sometimes it makes me a bit sad to know that I'm here alone.
I am also working from home from time to time. I could feel some time lonely.
I'm sorry to hear you are in the same boat sometimes. Do you have any advice on how to make it feel less lonely?
I usually get out after finishing work to feel less lonely.
Once on my way to work I slipped and fell after I got off the bus and everyone stared at me. I laid there until the bus drove away because I felt so humiliated.
Oh_comma_ that must have been so embarrassing.
The sad thing is I do stuff like that all the time :(
I'm sorry it happens to us at times.
I stopped at a gas station on the way to work last week and got gas and a scratch off ticket and won $500.
Congratulations! That is so cool!
Yes_comma_ it's the most money I  have ever won on a lottery ticket. It was very shocking.
I hope you have fun with that money.
Last week_comma_ one of my coworkers took credit for a job I had completed. I had to get to the manager to get things straightened out.
I can't believe your coworker would do that to you! Did your manager listen?
Yes he did. He knew that the other guy had been at a different job site_comma_ I will still not very happy about the situation.
I wouldn't be either. Are you going to try to talk to your coworker about it?
School starts back next week so last weekend I took my girls to Disney World.

Yes we did they loved it it was such a thrill and the shows and rides was so fun.
They will really appreciate that when they are older and look back on it.
Last spring_comma_ it rained so much my basement ended up flooding.

how did you feel at that time
I was out in the yard and I found a rabbits nest with a bunch of babies in it right in the middle of the yard!
Oh wow! Are the babies ok?
They are fine. I put some tree branches over it to give it some protection from predators and the elements
Good thinking. I'm sure the parent bunnies appreciated that.
All my cucumber plants died this week due to too much rain
Oh man. What a bummer!  I love cucumbers and hummus!  Do you have anything else you're growing that survived?
My tomatoes and peppers are doing really well for starters.
Oh good_comma_ I'm glad the entire garden didn't get ruined.  I would love to plant a garden one day soon since I went vegan plant based about 3 months ago.  Happy tomato eating to you!
the neighbor's trash can had blown over and there was garbage all over the road
Oh what a mess. I would hope that they picked it up.

midwest
ok im at the south east
Last week in the middle of the night_comma_ someone drove off the road and took out a large section of my fence around my yard.
ohh wow! That's not cool
They didn't stick around or anything and it's going to be pretty expensive to have it all replaced.
I wish people would take responsibilities for their own actions
i dropped my grocery bag in the parking lot and it spilled everywhere
Oh man! Hopefully nothing broke!
nope but i did have to chase down a few cans that rolled away lol
At least it sounds like you recovered everything!
i felt bad when i cut someone off in traffic this morning
He accused me of stealing from him

Sorry_comma_ that was an error! Any way over to your conversation.Who did you cut off that made you feel bad?
im envious of everyone who is outside enjoying the sun right now
Yea I hear ya. Im stuck here at work for another day too.

What is the test on? Have you prepared for it? I bet you will do better than you think!
yes i have studied quite a bit_comma_ thank you!
Good for you! I bet you will do amazing. Best of luck!
I have no friends. One time I went into a restaurant and ate by myself. Everyone laughed
i feel the same one and lately it seems to be getting worse. i've never been brave enough to go eat alone.
Yes_comma_ that is why I am in front of my computer all day.
i get that. i work all day then come home to the same routine everyday.
i envy everyone outside right now enjoying the weather
Me too! I'm stuck inside at work and hearing about how great it is out there.
im looking out the window waiting to go out lol
Haha_comma_ same! Just one more hour for me. Hope you can enjoy it soon!
A good co-worker of mine lost his job
That is not good_comma_ what happened
His boss felt he was under-performing.  It's a shame because he was fun to work with
That is never a good thing_comma_ I hope they land on their feet
A co-worker of mine was able to complete a complicated project quickly
How did they do that?
He was more skilled than I thought
Oh_comma_ well that is a nice surprise though!
I get so mad when workers don't wash their hands in restaurants I had this happen to me recent I left the place immediately.
That is nasty_comma_ how do they get away with that?
Right I was so sicken I said yes this will be the last time I go to this Pizza Hut it's like would you want someone to do you and your food that way.
Exactly_comma_ I would report them_comma_ so nasty
I did first thing the next morning.
My car has been acting strange lately
How so?
Strange noises and grinding_comma_ I hope it doesn't break down
I hope so too_comma_ get it checked out!
I bought a scratch lottery ticket for $20 and didn't win anything

My granddad means so much to me I still wear his necklace even though he passed.
I am sorry for your loss_comma_ at least you got some time together
Yes and thank you I know he is close in spirit I get emotional sometimes but the memories we had was great.
I feel that way about my grandma_comma_ it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old
The time just slips away have to cherish the time we have with them.
I thought the service Uber was good but I had a bad experience today was so upset.
I think lyft is better
I'll have to try them my Panera was over a hour late and my lunch was over once it arrived.
I would hate that
A close friend of mine is moving away
Where to?
Out of state_comma_ it's a shame because we were good friends
oh_comma_ I am sorry to hear that_comma_ why did they move away?
A friend of mine was able to build this complicated desk in a few hours
They sounds very complicated
He's very talented with tools_comma_ it'd probably take anyone else half a day at least
That is nice to have
A friend of mine is coming to visit
having friends over is always nice!
Yeah_comma_ he's a good friend_comma_ it'll be a lot of fun when he arrives
i bet. hope you all have a fantastic time!
A friend who I hadn't seen since school started work at my job
How do you feel about that?
He was the last person I expected to see
Are you guys in good relations?
I found some old school papers of mine
did it bring back a lot of old mermories?
Yeah_comma_ I've come a long way
thats good that you have progressed
A co-worker has been flirting with me at work.  I turned her down though since I have a girlfriend
She is a crappy person_comma_ flirting with someone who is in a relationship. Good on you- stand up guy
It's been hard though_comma_ I've had many girls interested in me lately
Lol- Well poor you. I have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me. If I am in a relationship..or heck even when I am not..I don't get interested in random people generally. I have to know who someone is..Remember that- what lasts is WHO someone is...Someone you want to grow old with..Bodies won't last.
One time while I was waking up in the middle of the night_comma_ I saw a little girl sitting beside my bed
That must of been weird. Who was it?

i took a taxi and the driver was sneezing right to my side
Ouch_comma_ that sounds pretty gross!
yah_comma_ it felt so distigusting
I'd avoid that taxi driver again if you have the chance.
Imagine_comma_i started working out two months ago_comma_only to weigh myself and i have gained some weight
I hope it was maybe the weight of the muscle that the scale was picking up.
I hope so_comma_i  got a little discouraged.But i will keep working out
Yes_comma_ don't let that stop you. Also pay attention to what you eat as well. It's even more important than the exercise portion.
I've been feeling pretty wholesome recently.
I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing. Which is it?
It's good_comma_ I just meant that I can be by myself and feel alright.
That's great! It's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.
About a week ago on the way home I smelt something so bad that it made me anxious.
What was it I wonder?
I don't even want to remember that smell.
It must've been nasty like puke
I always try to stay positive no matter what.'
I like that philosophy. Here lately_comma_ has it been easier or harder to stay positive?
Let's put it that way_comma_ even when it's harder I still remain positive.
I like that_comma_ how long have you felt this way about life?
Anytime the weather is sunny I feel happy.
wow_comma_ its good to warm
Yes_comma_ warmth is better than cold.
it is easier to walk around when its sunny also

What exactly did he do>
he tried to take my Driving licence by force on over speeding claims which was not true
Yes_comma_ some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs.

I know what you mean. Just believe in yourself
Last week my neighbor began making renovations on his home.
Is he being too noisy?
Yeah_comma_ that's the problem. On weekends he likes to start hammering and sawing at 5am.
I see how that can be annoying_comma_ have you asked him to stop doing that?
The day that I got accepted into nursing school was just an ordinary day.
You weren't excited about it?
Well I had been waiting for weeks and was unaware_comma_ but at the end of a stressful day I checked my mail and the letter came in to let me know if I got in or not.
I understand. Stress is a definite mood killer
I agree_comma_ but then I opened the letter and it ended up being the best day of my life!
I had an eye surgery recently now I am anxiously waiting for perfect vision.

I was acting like a arrogant peacock today.

i'm glad you were in a good mood.
A few days ago I've met a couple of people that got me feeling negative things_comma_ even though I don't even know them.
Did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way?
Not really_comma_ maybe just a bit_comma_ it's how they said it I guess.
I understand how that can make you feel a certain way. Unfortunately_comma_ there are those types of people around every corner.
Last week at work_comma_ my coworkers threw me a 20th anniversary party at our company office.
Oh Wow! 20 years at your job! You must be well liked there.
I like to think I am. I had no idea this was going to happen.
It must have been a wonderful surprise for you.
My mom called me the day after my 28 birthday. Not to wish me happy birthday_comma_ but to delivery awful news.
Oh my goodness_comma_ what was the terrible news?
She called and told me our brother had been in a terrible accident and that we needed to come to the ER immediately.
I am so sorry_comma_ I hope your brother ended up being okay.
No he passed away that day. I will never forget the day after my 28 birthday. It was pretty aweful.
I have not had any sleep for the past three days only to come back home and my neighbor is having a loud party
Dang_comma_ that's not good. What did you end up doing??
I stormed into his house like a mad man_comma_i was not having it.That had to stop.
Oh wow. Did the police get called? I hope you didn't get in trouble.
i'm eagerly anticipating the break from the routine of business
Yeah? What is changing?
i'm going on a holiday soon!
Brilliant. here are you going?
bora bora
Amazing! and Exotic
As a nursing student I'm able to look forward to take care of people when they are feeling bad.
That's so generous of you. The world could use more people like you.
Yes during on of my clinical rounds I was able to handle pediatric patients which I felt so happy to do.
Caring for both the young and the old. Any hospital would be lucky to have you on staff!
i forgot my friend's birthday date
Oh my_comma_ how did she react?
she was confused because i showed up a week late
Ha! Do you feel bad about it?
i am so embarrassed.
Looking for a new job can be stressful.
It certainly can. What type of job are you looking for?
Well I went on 4 interviews to work in a clinic and all went well_comma_ but they have not called me back and its been a week now.
Maybe they had lots of other candidates to see
Yeah_comma_ but bills are coming up so its making me very worried and nervous.
I know that feeling. Something will come through though
Yeah maybe if at least one calls me than my patients well let up. I cant stop waiting next to my cell phone. Each call I get I get excited.
Have you ever felt guilty for sleeping all day?
Yes! I feel like the day escaped me. Have you done that recently?
Yes_comma_ I am thinking to do it again today though.
It is Friday_comma_ that would be a nice way to start the weekend!
i am so jealous because my sibling is going on a holiday and i have work to do
Ugh I can imagine. But your time will come_comma_ be patient!
yeah but i really need a break
Have you tried yoga? It can help in the meanwhile till you get a proper vacation.
i haven't_comma_ i guess i will do that.
Yeah I went into the hospital with chest pain and the doctors came in and told me I needed to have emergency surgery.
Oh no! Did you get the surgery?
I did and what an experience. I was alone in the hospital getting prepped for a major surgery not knowing if I was going to make it.
But you have recovered now. Right?
Yea everthing is going well_comma_ but it still sends chills down my spine
We both want a boy_comma_ but a girl at this point would be perfect as well
Are you pregnant?
Yes after several attmpts me and my wife are finally expecting. This news is the best that I have heard!
Congratulations! That's brilliant news
I agree. I'm jumping with happiness right now. I cant wait to be a dad.
I got my final exam results the other day and I did really well.
Good job! Do you feel proud of yourself?
yes very. Those longs nights I stayed up getting ready helped.
Hard work always pays off! Keep it up.
I agree. This is a lesson learned in life to always be ready for whats coming up.
I walked into the room while she was cooking and was very quiet. I felt bad about what I did.
What did you do?
Well I went out with old college buds and got trashed and slept with another woman.
Man! That's pretty bad.
Yeah I could not look her in her face to tell her.
am so nervous my sister is going for surgey
i hope it goes well for her
we hope so too
good luck!
I didnt study for my test and I felt I bombed it_comma_ but when I checked my grade I made an A!
Awesome! Glad that you did well on the exam!
I agree. I was soooo not expecting that. im still boggled by it_comma_ but it made my day.
Now you can celebrate this exam result! Always feels good to accomplish something like this.
Yes I agree. Even now I cant beleive I made an A!
A man recently tried to break into our house late at night.
oh wow. that is some scary stuff!! what happend?
It was about 3am. He was kicking our front door repeatedly.  My kids and wife were terrified as we waited for the cops to come.
did they catch the person?
They found him down the block_comma_ kicking at another house's door.  He was arrested_comma_ I believe.
i feel guilty for lying to mom that i had passed my exams
You shouldn't like to your mom. I think you should tell her the truth about what really happened.
yah_comma_ i will tell her when she comes back from work
That sounds like a great idea!
I felt very unpleasant last week when i fell to the ground skateboarding and lots of people saw it happen
Oh no! You have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail
Yeah it was bad but i kept practicing and eventually learned pretty quick
That's good! Practice makes perfect and if everyone stopped when they failed_comma_ we would not have as much as we do today
Last week at work a coworker tried to take credit for a job that I had completed.
That's terrible. Did you let others know that you had completed the job?
I talked to my boss and get it all straightened out_comma_ but it was still a really crazy situation.
I could imagine. Some people stoop low to take credit for what others do.
I recently had surgery and needed help around the house and my best friend volunteered to help me.
what kind of surgery was it?
I had knee surgery so my normal household chores is hard to keep up but she kept her word and she has helped 2 a week since she is so true to her word I have a great friend.
Thats awesome! Its great to have friends their for someone.
My dog chewed my favorite pair of shoes up last week.
Oh no! Did you scold him?
No she got me with those eyes but I was very irate with her for a few days and she knew it.
I'd be angry too_comma_ but it's hard to get mad at doggos.
It is they are loving she didn't mean to I bet lol.
I finished college this summer and now I'm on to a new job in nursing I am nervous.
Congrats to you!  What kind of nurse are you looking to be?
I will be a RN I think I am over thinking the new role but I am self assured I will do great this is my passion.
I have no doubt that you will be a great RN!
College is the top way to get in debt but my brother paid all his tuition out of pocket.
That is awesome_comma_ what is his secret?
He worked 2 jobs and prior to starting he saved money I'm very influenced by his method I'm going to give it a try so I can be debt free as well.
Being debt free can be a great feeling
Last year my wife got laid off from her job.
Im sorry to hear that. Does she have a job now?
At the time it happened_comma_ my boss found out about it and gave me more hours to make up for our loss of income till she got another job.
Well that was nice of your boss. Its great to have good people in this world
My girlfriend is moving in this weekend.  This is the first relationship I have had that actually will be living with me.
Are you excited for it?
I am very excited for it.  Im ready to start this next chapter in my life and hoping everything goes well after the move.
I hope this is the true love for you
I have a job interview coming up later this week.  I feel confident about it but would love for it to be over
You got this just be yourself and professional obviously and don't over think it.
Thats my plan going into it.  It would be awesome if I got the job but if not I am happy where I am at too
You will get it happy thoughts only and if not something better is in store.
I love to help my daughter with her school work and exams.
It sounds like you are a great parent.  Does she appreciate all the help you give?
Thank you and yes she does the memories together just pleases me so much I cherish these moments.
She will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too.  I still remember my dad helping me with math homework and cant thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years.
After being married for 8 years to my first wife_comma_ I found out she was having an affair behind my back.
Im sorry about that. How did you find out?
She came out and told me about it. It was one of the worst times in my life.
That stinks. Are you still with her or did you leave her?
My dog just learned how to ring the bell on the doorknob when he needs to go out
Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?
I put the bell on the door so it would ring when it opened and he got used to that_comma_ so now he associates the sound with having to go out.
That is amazing. Must be a very smart dog.
I canceled a dinner with a old friend because I was just so tired had a long work week.
I understand! As we get older_comma_ it's hard to do it all everyday!
It is I just feel a little guilt-ridden because I told her I had an emergency instead of telling her the truth because she would have tried to talk me into still coming out.
It happens_comma_ but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you
Last month my car threw a rod and needed to have the engine overhauled_comma_ leaving me without a way to get to work and back.
Oh no_comma_ are you able to afford the repair for it?
Well_comma_ a friend of mine let me borrow his car for a entire month while mine was repaired. He just tossed me the keys and said bring it back when your done.
What a great friend you have. Definitly get him a gift when you are done.
I working to save enough money to take my wife on a vacation to Vermont next year. I hope I can save enough.
I hope you can too. How is it going?
I'm about half way there. I want to save enough to rent a cottage on one of the lakes up there so I still have a ways to go.
That's great! I have faith that you can do it.
Thank you. I hope i reach my goal.
I paid off my credit card before buying my house.  I didnt realize how expensive owning would be and after some repairs I owe more than I started with on my card.
That's really good! Do you think you're ever going to use the card again?
Im hoping I wont have to.  Unless something major comes up I'm not planning on putting anything on credit again.
That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that_comma_ I'm cutting them up.
I was with some friends and went up to my room.  It was late at night and the lights were off.  When I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.
That would have really scared me.
It did scare me.  I let out a scream.  One of my friends went to school for wildlife.  He captured the bat and let it outside which was great.
I bet you are thankful that your friend was there.
I brought home a cake for my family_comma_ but I ate all of it! Ugh.
All of it??? Oh no. How bad do you feel right now?
Uhm_comma_ I feel awesome in my tummy_comma_ but bad in my heart LOL
Haha I bet. Im sure they were looking forward to it.
My roommate was very forgetful.  He would sometimes leave his dogs poop bags inside instead of bringing them out to the garage.
ewww.
It was gross.  All of a sudden you would smell something and then notice the bag sitting there.
Why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?
I was watching TV and saw people with a happy family. It breaks my heart.
You are having trouble with family ?
My family isn't close_comma_ it's depressing.
Mine isn't either. Are you married?
I'm so hyped_comma_ I'm going to the movies!
Awesome! What are you going to see?
Not sure yet_comma_ I'll have to ask my friends
Whatever it is_comma_ I hope you have a good time!
I broke my leg_comma_ it's so upsetting.
Oh no!  How'd you do that?
I fell off a roof!
What were you doing on the roof?
We decided to go fishing last week.
Did you catch anything?
No!  And I was so confident that we would!
Did you at least have fun?
We did!  And some of the research work that we did let us experiment more than normal.
My daughter graduated high school!
congrats! you must be proud!
I am_comma_ thanky ou!
My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go
I believed my father wouldn't let me down.
That is good to feel that way. You don't want to feel like someone close to you would let you down. Did it work out for you?
No_comma_ he totally bailed on me_comma_ as usual.
Oh I am sorry. That is sad. Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you.
I'm about to move and I'm terrified! What if it has bugs? Or mold? Or something else I don't know about?
Oh gosh_comma_ you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear
Yes! I can't imagine them crawling on me when I sleep :/
I would have a heart attack!
I remember eating my Baba's pierogies as a child_comma_ so yummy.
I have no idea what those are!
They are ukrainian pasta_comma_ kind of like stuffed pasta.
oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?
I am so sad I have no pierogies.
What are pierogies? a type of food?
They are Ukrainian dumplings.
Ah nice_comma_ I love dumplings_comma_ what are in them?
The milk I drank this mornign went bad!
That's no good_comma_ did you throw it out?
Yes_comma_ but not before I drank some. :/
Hope you don't get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.
I once had a fluffy cat named Leo_comma_ but he got lymphoma and I had to have him put to sleep.
Oh_comma_ I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him!
I'm sorry to hear about your lab as well. They are very sweet dogs.
Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly!
I love ginger cats! Leo was a ginger_comma_ and I have one right now named Chunk.
This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!
Yikes! That doesn't sound pleasant_comma_ but I know they do that to try to show you they like you. They think you appreciate the gifts.
Oh_comma_ I shouldn't be ungrateful_comma_ lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!
I was so happy!  I have been working so hard for this company since I started so this is a great sign in my opinion!
Did you get a promotion?
Not yet but I did get a raise!  If the company takes over I will get to be in charge of the helpdesk though!
Wow_comma_ great job!
Thank you! It's insane up here sometimes but I feel like I could be a good team lead.
I'm really scared to go back to school.
Oh no!  What has you scared?
It's all new to me_comma_ I've never done it before
It'll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.
My mother died_comma_ I'm a mess.
oh dang thats so horrible
Thank you :(
it gets better with time but it must be hard
I really miss Hastings.  I spent so much time in that store when I first started college.  Both just hanging out and working.
I remember that store! I loved going shopping there_comma_ was it your first job?
It wasn't my first but it was my most favorite retail job I had
Yeah_comma_ I bet_comma_ it looked like a fun place to work.  Especially for a college job.
It really was.  It was so  laid back and chill.  I also made a ton of great friends there.
I pray I can do well in school
Are you having any specific problem areas?
Not yet_comma_ but I haven't started yhet
Okay. I hope you do well too.
I've really wanted a Ford Excursion for a long time.
Interesting_comma_ those things are huge_comma_ Do they even make them any more?
They haven't made them for quite a few years.  But I met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days!
Do you have a large family_comma_ or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?
We don't have a huge family_comma_ just 5.  But my wife does daycare_comma_ and our current vehicle only has 5 seats_comma_ so she's stuck at home fairly frequently.
5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.
Thanks!  If not_comma_ we'll still manage just fine.  It would be nice_comma_ though.
I'm scared to go to the cottage
It is a big change. What is scaring you?
I don't like bugs!
I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in
I am sad my cousin is moving away.
Is it really far?
Yes_comma_ another country
oh no. im sorry to hear that
I had some friends over and went upstairs to my room.  All the lights were off and when I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.
Well_comma_ that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?
Hahahaha_comma_ that piece hadnt crossed my mind although it should have with all the vampire movies I had seen!  I let out a scream and one of my friends captured the bat and let it outside to be free.
Well_comma_ that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!
I was totally ready for my garage sale
You were ready? That's good to hear.
Yes and we made $1026.25!
Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif
I have an interview coming up.  Its for a position that someone else already has but I need to do this interview to get my name out there and let the higher ups know I want to move into management.
Are you prepared?
I am prepared for it.  I'll be a lot happier once it is over.
I bet. Good luck to you
I went to work the other day_comma_ and I was the only person in the office.
Where you supposed to be there? If so_comma_ then that is a nice feeling.
Yeah_comma_ everyone else was just gone.  It was nice for a while_comma_ but got a bit lonely.
Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also.
It did toward the end of the day for sure!
I am starting back at school next month. I am excited about getting back into my classes.
That's great. What classes are you taking?
I'm a computer science student. The one I'm most excited about is Microprocessors.
That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?
I want to be a software developer I think_comma_ so I like the programming.
You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.
I really like school_comma_ so you never know what I might decide to go for next. Thank you for the advice.
Any time. Have a good weekend :D
My dog just died in my arms.
Did that happen tonight?
No_comma_ it was a few years ago.
Well_comma_ it must've been something you said.
My step-daughter just turned 16 in the past week.
Did she have a party?
We're actually having it this coming weekend.
Does she have her license yet?
No . . . that's a long story involving her idiot father.  I'm somewhat glad_comma_ though_comma_ as she can't seem to set her phone down.
Well_comma_ there's no hurry in driving_comma_ is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??
Text_comma_ video chat_comma_ watch some goofball put makeup on_comma_ and shop.  Things most teenagers do_comma_ I suppose.
Does she play any sports?
I watch my girlfriends dog every once in a while and she just isnt getting potty training.  She is a little over 5 months old and some weeks she does a great job and the next week she'll go to the bathroom everywhere but outside.
That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice_comma_ but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.
I do understand that part too.  I actually got a puppy a couple months before her so I went through this all.  I just wish her puppy listened as well as mine because he took a couple months as has been doing great since.  I know it'll click eventually...I just wish shed hurry up :)
It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it_comma_ but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!
I was shocked by my present.
You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?
It was my anniversary.
Well_comma_ happy anniversary! What was your present?
Humanity is the worst.
I agree.. Did something happen?
No_comma_ just frustrated
I'm sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.
My mom spent a lot of money buying me a computer for my birthday
That was nice
Yes_comma_ I love my mom and I will give her something even better for her birthday!
Do you have anything in mind?
My old roommate never did any dishes.  He also didnt wash any food off the plates so we had a sink full of dirty dishes and rotting food at all time.  It was miserable living there.
So_comma_ I take you left to live someplace else?
Haha yes_comma_ I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people.
Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place_comma_ EVER!!!!!!
I recently tried to get a manager's job in my company_comma_ two others and myself were the last three in the running for the job.
Very nice_comma_ congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?
I had much more experience than both of them_comma_ but ended up not getting the job. I am still pretty upset about it.
I would be upset too.  However_comma_ I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.
My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but he made it through college
That's great_comma_ it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.
I was.  I know how hard it was for him so it was great seeing that hard work pay off in the long run.
Well_comma_ hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future.
My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but made it through it.
I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?
He did!  He actually just started a new job that he loves and is related to his degree.
That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?
My girlfriend is moving in this weekend.  It will be great finally living together.
Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?
We have been dating almost a year.  I'm just excited to take this next step in the relationship.
It's a huge step_comma_ congratulations!
My girlfriends aunt just died.  She wasnt close to her but is still devastated because of the impact it had on her sister.  I'm doing whatever I can to help them both.
Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.
Thats very true.  I know she feels bad for not keeping as close contact as she could have with her aunt now.
Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.
My friend and coworker hasnt been coming into work.  People are starting to talk but its hard to stick up for him when he only comes in once or twice a week.
Is he sick or just being lazy?
A little bit of both.  He has bad anxiety but he also has told me he just doesnt like going into work.
I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.
One time during Kindergarten_comma_ I peed myself because the teacher did not let me go to the restroom
Oh_comma_ well that's awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!
Thanks! Luckily I am potty trained now!
LOL_comma_ well_comma_ that's good to know. So am I!
One of my well knows patients that has horrible diabetes came in today for a follow up.
Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?
Yes. After 3 years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake. I checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!
That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition_comma_ especially those with diabetes.
I agree!. I was so proud of her and her test results surprised me!
The first time my girlfriend slept over I farted on her leg in the middle of the night.  She knew it happened but didnt say anything.  She also doesnt know that I know.
Thats... uh... strange?
It was embarrassing but I think that she stayed with me is after is a good sign!
I think so_comma_ you're two peas in a pod.
I'm trying to get some work done and my dog just wants to play!  I love him to death but he needs to learn to be independent at times too!
Pets are great_comma_ but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great_comma_ but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.
Thats very true.  After our first conversation I might have to take a break and play with him a bit.  I might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out.
A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back_comma_ then you can get some work done.
One time when I was letting my cat outside_comma_ it ran out into the streets and got ran over
Oh my god! That's terrible!
Then I woke up_comma_ it was all a dream.
Oh that's so great!
my son just won first place at his championship swim meet!
That's amazing!  Congratulations!  Swimming can be tough
Thank you! He takes to it like a fish in water. HaHA!
LOL I bet you use that line all the time!  I love it
One time when using the public restroom_comma_ I had toilet paper hanging from my shoe when I went outside
Oh man! I hope no one noticed.
Unfortunately I kept getting looks! It's alright though!
I'm glad that it all worked out!
I have a goal I want to get on here tonight but my dog really wants to play.  I feel bad that I'm not playing with him but would really like to hit my goal before I do.
Oh_comma_ I bet you are really torn.
I am_comma_ I would think I'll be done pretty soon and then take him for a nice long walk.
I'm sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.
My girlfriend broke up with me recently
That's one of the hardest parts of life. What happened??
We drifted apart it seems
That is hard! Relationships are hard work.
A friend of mine drove me to work when my car broke down
That is great of them_comma_ did you do anything to pay them back?
I took him out to dinner later on_comma_ he's a good friend
That is nice of you_comma_ glad you have supportive friends!
I saw a mouse run across my kitchen floor
Aw poor mouse. I have had a few before..We actually rescued a few from our cat :/
I hope I can catch it at some point
They have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks. Mice really are sweet natured.
A co-worker of mine was late with work materials
What happened to them?
I eventually got them_comma_ but it almost cost me this project I've been working on
Good_comma_ sorry you were inconvenienced_comma_ hope things get more consistent!
I was watching my girlfriends son the other weekend and was trying to think of an activity we could do together.  I decided on cooking and got everything before he came over.
that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking.
Yeah_comma_ he seemed to have a good time.  We made cheese too which was a first for both of us.  It turned out pretty good too which was nice.
that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella
I am nervous for my college test
Did you study for it at least?
I did but it is a law school exam. You just never know.
That is true_comma_ well best of luck to you friend!
I was walking around my office and someone spilled coffee on me
That is bad. What did you do after that?
I went to the bathroom to clean up_comma_ it was a new shirt as well
Did he say sorry?
When I came home_comma_ a TV show I had set to record was all ready to go
What show was it?
Black Mirror
is that the one with Bryce Dallas Howard?
I keep remembering my old college days
Oh? What about them?
Just how fun and carefree they were.
That's true. Any memory in particular?
I'm spending my first summer in Massachusetts. It's a lot hotter than I expected it to be.
Is it really? How hot is it there?
The hottest it got was 99 degrees. It has been in the mid 80s mostly_comma_ but I was expecting cooler weather in New England.
That is hot_comma_ but it is a bit hotter where I live here
I don't like it at all_comma_ but I can put up with it until fall.
I was all alone when my family left for the weekend.
Did you feel lonely_comma_ or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?
A bit sad. More bored than anything.
That is tough when you're not used to being alone.  What did you end up doing?
I'm looking forward to meeting with some friends on the weekend
Oh that's cool!  What do you all have planned?
Probably go hiking and visit some local towns
Well that sounds like a fun little trip.
After a long day I finally got my dog settled down and I dont have any work.  It feels nice to just sit for a little bit.
thats nice to be able to relax
Have you had a good day?  Hopefully you dont have a busy weekend and can relax a little bit.
everyday is a good day!
I feel ready for the coming work week
Really? You must really like you job then
Yeah_comma_ I think I have all my work materials set
Good for you! I hope you  have good week!
I had an online interview today for a teaching position and I nailed it!
Awesome! I am happy for you!
Thanks! Regardless I am a bit nervous. There are a lot of things to remember and I don't want to look like a fool on the job.
I am sure you will do fine! Good Luck!
I found out recently that my girlfriend's cat has cancer and we cannot afford the operation to remove it.
Oh I am so sorry. Best thing to do is be there for her.
Thank you for your sympathies. Have you ever dealt with losing a pet?
I have and it really hard. It just takes time But a good support system makes it way better.
I'm happy to hear you were able to get through it over time.
My girlfriend was having a bad day at work a few days ago.
how did she handle it
Well_comma_ I sent her some pizza and it was so unexpected it turned her whole day around!
well that was nice of you
I spent two hours studying material for an interview.
did it help?
Definitely. I aced it_comma_ and now I'm officially in a trial period!
congrats! i hope it works out
A while back_comma_ I intervened when I saw my dad was picking on my younger sister.
That was good of you.  He didn't hurt her did he?
No_comma_ but he was just being mean. So mean he decided to kick me out of the house.
Oh no!!! Where did you end up going?
To my girlfriend's place. Luckily it only lasted a week_comma_ and my Mom is super caring and loving. She took me back in against his wishes.
That was so awesome of your mom :)
Walking home alone from school one day_comma_ three young adults jumped in front of me and yelled in my face.
Why did they do that?
For no good reason; there are evil people in this world. I was so scared I cried on the way back home.
That is terrible. Those days_comma_ a lot of people do stupid things.
I wasn't sure how he would do since he didn't go to PreK.
Children usually do really well_comma_ they are versatile.
I have heard that_comma_ but now I truly believe that!
I hope he continues to do well.
My daughter is officially all grown up she is leaving and going off to college next week.
Are you excited or will it be lonely?
In between I am very positive that she will be ok but just the thought of your first born going into the real world away from you is scary a little but I know she will be just fine.
Yeah that is scary. I am sure she will do great things though!
My kids was away all summer I missed them like crazy when they was gone.
I bet it was really quiet and lonely. Did you find some time for yourself though?
A little to quite and I was very lonely I'm glad it's over lol I started isolating my self to much when they was away.
I don't think I would like that quiet either.
I know I have high potential so the fact I failed my college course had me down.
Well that's not good. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test?
The test and the whole semester I just didn't give it my all like I should have and now I feel really crappy and regretful I need to redo course and give it my all.
Never be too confident! You've got to give life your all at every step.
Some restaurants just have the worst workers they are so rude and mean to us the customers.
I agree. I dont know why they work in the service industry if they don't like to be nice
Exactly what is even worse is the managers who are just as rude_comma_ I get so upset I had this happen to me at Wendy's staff was so unprofessional.
Fast food employees are the worst sometimes... it's like we bother them
I will officially be a first time home owner next month.
How exciting!!!  I bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn_comma_ etc..
I am this is all I ever wanted for my family and it is about to come I am so thrilled with joy can't wait.
I can imagine!  It is certainly an exciting time.  I bet you are just over the moon happy!
Do you have any experience about it
Any experience with what?
Anything that made you happy
Yes some things
can you share anything
I packed a sandwich before I went to work
Are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?
Yup_comma_ and I am too lazy to drive out to a restaurant!
Well_comma_ it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break.
One time I saw poop smeared all over the public restroom
Oh my! I bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there.
Yup the smell was disgusting!
Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?
One time I looked at the mirror and thought I saw a monster
Whoa! That is really scary! I've felt weird sensations like that before.
Yeah. Unfortunately_comma_ it was a monster! I am just ugly!
No! I'm sure you are not as monster-ish as you think!
My mom spent a lot of money to buy me a computer
Aw that's nnice of her
Yup! She worked hard for like 3 weeks to save up for it! I love her!
Moms are the best
One time while I was camping_comma_ there was a giant rattle snake trying to attack us
Did you kill the snake?
Nope! I packed up and went straight home!
That is too bad_comma_ will you ever camp again?
I had business meeting about a year ago where I had to rely a lot on my co-worker.
Did they do a good job?
Surprisingly they he did_comma_ I guess sometimes we I need to trust people.
Did you take them out for drinks after the meeting?
I had dumplings at a hotel yesterday_comma_ and for a hotel restaurant food they were actually good.
sounds awesome
Yes_comma_ it was a tasty lunch.
i would have loved to do the same
I got into an argument the other day with my 18 year old son.  I still feel badly about it
Did you resolve things?
Yes eventually_comma_ but I am sorry to admit that I said things I should have never said to him out of anger.
I hope you can get over that pain.
Thanks_comma_ me too.  I should have remained calm and not called him names and say things I didnt mean.
One time I bought a scratch lottery ticket and won $20!
That's awesome! It would be amazing to win a million one day. One can dream.
Yup_comma_ I am going to buy another one just because of you! I hope I win!
That's great. I hope you do! Maybe this time you can get $40. But gamble only in moderation!
I was upset when my family kept leaving me on vacation
That is really upsetting!
It was. I just wanted some quality family time.
Well forget them! If they don't care about you you don't need to care about them
My cousin and I used to beat eachother with sticks.
for fun?
Yeah. We called it the box game and walked around inside of a refrigerator box for protection.
well that sounds pretty fun!
I was very well prepared for my law exam.
Were you satisfied with the results?
I was! 95%
Excellent!
I enthusiastically told my family about everything wrong with my life at that point.
how did it go
Not good. I was very drunk though
oh well maybe next time
Quitting smoking was so much easier than I expected it to be!
how many days has it been?
2 years
wow thats great!
I was grossed out when I saw someone vomit outside a bar.
Drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general.
For sure. it was not a pretty sight.
Some people can't hold their liquor.
Life is a lot better when you can eat solid food. Never get your jaw wired shut it sucks.
I can imagine. What happend that you got your jaw wired?
I got punched while drunk without a mouth guard years ago - still think about it !
Man that sounds aweful.
Life is good right now for me too
Nice.  Always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can't touch you
Right just staying active_comma_ don't need much money_comma_ minimal drama. Easy
Absolutely
I used to feel lonely a lot as a teenager. That was dumb of me
I feel like everyone goes through that phase.  I know I did too
I've noticed that it's easier to be happy while not around someone all the time.
Would you say you're more of an introvert?
August is way too hot.
Especially in the south
Right. I live as north as you're gonna get in the US and it still sucks.
Oh wow_comma_ that does sound horrible
GED test was super easy. I was confident that I would pass it
did you find out the results?
Yeah I crushed
dang thats awesome!
Two years ago I decided to go back to school after working at my job for 12 years. At the time I was very nervous about my decision.
Oh wow and you couldn't keep your job? What were you going to school for?
I still work there_comma_ but just part time now. I am studying Computer Science.
Oh wonderful! One of the best fields to be in right now
I love it. Just ten more classes to go until I finish.
Wow! Good luck_comma_ there are so many things you can do with that degree and from home too!
Thank you! I hope to work from home.
My grandparents have been married for 50 years I hope to be like that one day.
That is awesome. I never even get a second date A husband may not be in the cards lol
lol you just haven't came across the right person yet. It is incredible I arranged and had them a surprise dinner party it turned out very nice.
Thats sweet. I bet they enjoyed it
Here in Florida the traffic and wrecks is bad and always happening.
I hate bad traffic_comma_ did you get in an accident?
Due to a reckless driver running the red light_comma_ but most wrecks I have witnessed come from careless drivers or drivers driving slow in the fast lane and get tail ended I get so irritated I swear.
That's the worst_comma_ I hate when people are careless.
I get so angry when people stand me up it's so rude.
I know what you mean
My coworker did this recent we was suppose to have lunch she didn't call or anything.
that sucks. have you talked to her?
Seen her at work but she has been avoiding me even more rude but never again will I plan an outing with her.
Professional settings is suppose to get along and be great but not my place of work staff fight like cats and dogs there.
That is awful.  I agree.  A professional setting is supposed to be ... well_comma_ professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?
We have a team building coming up and let's hope this works which I predict it will be some type of good outcome.
I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building_comma_ communication_comma_ and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.
I just drove 12 hours back from my parents' house. It wasn't so bad though_comma_ because I actually packed everything I needed for once. I was able to minimize the amount of stops I took and cut two hours off of the total time it took!
Wow_comma_ you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?
I work. We moved far from where they grew up when I was young_comma_ and they ended up moving back for retirement.
I see. Well_comma_ it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life
I was pretty bummed to find out that my favorite coworker is transferring to a different department.
I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?
Once in a while_comma_ here and there.
At least they aren't gone completely_comma_ but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life.
I prequalified for a mortgage last week online. The bank I applied with has called me 3 times a day ever since. I'm getting pretty frustrated.
i would be really annoyed myself_comma_ why so many frequent calls ?
I'm not sure. This is my first time shopping for a mortgage_comma_ so I'm not sure if it's normal or not.
i know ever since i purchased a new car_comma_ i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day _comma_ its really annoying
I watched Wimbledon for the first time last summer. Those tennis players are SO GOOD!
I know right! my parents love tennis_comma_ so I grw up watching it.
I had played a little bit growing up_comma_ but never watched it professionally.
were you ever any good at it?
It was so life-like and I have such fond memories of playing in there.  My stepdad worked for pillsbury and brought home dough and I would pretend I was baking.
Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of. Can you bake now for real?
Yes somewhat_comma_ although with all that practice in childhood I should be much better.   I miss my stepdad so much.   I have nothing but fond memories of him.
Are you still in contact with him?
I looked at a house I really liked last week_comma_ but just found out it was taken off the market.
Oh that sucks. I hate when that happens.
Yeah_comma_ it'll be okay though. There's always something else that will come available.
I bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one.
I had to drive 12 hours straight last week. For once it wasn't terrible_comma_ because I packed everything I needed. Took two hours fewer than it normally does!
That sounds exhausting! Were you driving for work or just taking a vacation?
Vacation. Went to go visit my parents.
I'm sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family.
I came home from work_comma_ expecting an empty apartment. My boyfriend was home from his trip a day early!
Was he alone?
Yes_comma_ I was very excited to see him.
Cool. Did you do something special?
I got a promotion at work! I'm so excited!
Congrats
Thank you!
Do you get a raise?
My bank has called me three times a day for the past week_comma_ and I'm tired of it.
Probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account
No_comma_ I prequalified for a mortgage_comma_ and they've been wanting me to speak to a loan specialist ever since.
Are you interested in mortgage for now?
My roommate leaves her leftovers in the fridge for a disgusting amount of time.
Oh that is really gross! Have you talked to her about it?
No_comma_ I don't feel like it's my place to tell her what to do.
If you share the fridge_comma_ I'd let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food.
I came home expecting an empty apartment_comma_ but my boyfriend had come home a day early from his trip!
cool. did he have gifts?
No_comma_ but I'm not big on gifts.
Oh. I am lol
Do you feel anything like that
Like what? Bad or miserable?
sad_comma_ when you see beggar in the street
Yes indeed. Seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces
What do you think when you see them
Next month my wife and I are going on our first vacation_comma_ I can hardly wait.
Wow. enjoy your own time.
I will_comma_ it is going to be great to get away together.
Yeah_comma_ you're right. Hope you've memorable vacation.
My ex boyfriend and I started having trouble getting along and we were under a lot of stress over money.   After awhile of this he started putting a password on his cell phone so I couldnt get in to see his messages.  THat was the first sign!
Wao_comma_thats really not cool
NO_comma_ not cool at all.  We ended up breaking up for a bit and he didnt waste any time before seeing this girl.   I wasted four years of my life for that to happen.
He doesnt deserve you_comma_so wipe your tears
I found myself suddenly by myself and it seemed as if all the people I had become friends with were no longer wanting to still be friends.  I mostly met all of them through him when we got together_comma_ and when he left me he told them not to speak to me anymore and they listened.
That's sad. But I'm sure they stil want to be firends with you too
I dont think they do.  He was an abusive guy and he didnt want me to have them as friends and he would make up lies about me .  I dont think it was so much the lies he made up because they knew they were not true.  I think they were just loyal to him.
Posibly. Sounds like you are better off without him though
I love it when the buildbuilding is comingfrom me
That's awesome_comma_ I wish I could build my own house.
Is the conversation over? You are welcome then.
Well thank you as well.
Her name was Lily and she was a pit bull_comma_ my favorite breed.   I loved her so much.  We did everything together.  She would go wherever I did.
Did she die recently?
No she had to go to the humane society when my ex boyfriend and I broke up.   I had no choice_comma_ and he did it just to hurt me.  Lily would go swimming with me_comma_ ride on our boat etc.  When she was just a pup she would sit on my lap as i rode the four wheeler.
Oh wow! Thats so sad_comma_ I know animals can be like kids to use. I'm so sorry
He was originally suspended at 17 when he again got got with a little bit of weed.  They have a law here in missouri called 21 and under law.  Automatically get suspended for a year if ur a minor in possession.
That can ruin a persons life.
I know it can which is why I was so worried at court.  THe judge looked at him and said son you need to hire you a lawyer.  I  throw people in jail for things like this.
That is such a mess.
The best thing happened at work today!
Tell me more_comma_ sounds exciting!
Well we have these weekly meetings about our goals and today I was recognized by name in front of everyone for a job well done.
Good on you! You finally got recognition for your hard work
Ugh! Tonight was such a bummer.
Oh no what happened?
I was going to go to a concert but couldn't get myself to go by myself at the last minute. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.
What concert was it?
It was an annual block party we have here with a local lineup of musicians. I really liked the lineup!
That probably would have been fun.
The aftermath was awful.  Trash and debris was everywhere and we were homeless.  We lived out in the country and it took some time before red cross came out to do their report and get help to us.
That sounds terrible. I hope you're okay now.
I am doing better now but it was really hard times.  We had moved everything up higher as we never expected our whole house to go.  Unfortunately we had all our belongings in the house as well.
Well all the matters is that no one was hurt. You can buy property again but not lives.
I ordered a new phone last week_comma_ and when the box got here it was empty.
That is so messed up!
Yeah_comma_ I was pretty upset_comma_ especially when they initially refuse to refund my money.
I would be so angry.
A few years back I had to bury my dog_comma_ who had died at the age of 13.
Oh wow_comma_ What kind of dog was it? I'm so sorry that must've been super hard
He was a lab.  It broke my heart_comma_ to be honest.
I can imagine. I haven't had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and I'm dreading the day
I thought I would never get the chance or opportunity to better my life as well as my childrens.  I cant wait till I get that degree
That's wonderful that you are pursuing a degree. What is it in?
I am getting a counseling degree to help abused women.  I feel I would make a good counselor since I  have been in a few abusive relationships myself.
That is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others. You can really make a difference!
I saw a video game trailer recently that really brought me back!
Yeah? Which game was it for?
The new Spyro Remastered game coming out. Seeing it really reminded me of how I used to play the original all day with an old friend of mine.
Nice. The original Spyro is a classic.
I had a flat on the way to work this morning_comma_ and the jack handle was missing from my car.
Oh no. What did you do?
I used a screwdriver to work the jack. It sucked_comma_ lol.
Lol_comma_ well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time?
Yep_comma_ with 5 minutes to spare. (No pun intended)
I just celebrated my birthday and it was so much better than usual.
That's great. What made it so special this year?
I usually don't do much to celebrate but this year a friend of mine got all my other friends together to throw a party for me without me knowing. It was a great time.
Sounds like fun! I'm glad you had a happy birthday.
My wife and I have tried to have a baby for over three years_comma_ and had given up hope.  Two weeks ago_comma_ we found out she was pregnant.
I am so happy for you! Congrats!
Thank you!  We were both pretty shocked by the news_comma_ lol.
I wish you nothing but the best!
I was in an extremely dangerous abusive relationship at the time and I knew he was intending to put her in the middle of it all.   He intended to use her for leverage over me .
It sounds like you're talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  I'm a little confused.
Oh my I am getting ahead of myself.  I was referring to when I had to put my daughter emerson up for adoption in 2011.
Ouch that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.
Ugh! My friend is definitely getting on my nerves today.
Why what happened? Are y'all on a trip?
We made plans to catch up but never set a time. I tried to contact him to figure out what time and he never got back to me. I was looking forward to catching up.
Oh wow_comma_ so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too
Yes_comma_ I pray not to be found or trapped like they trapped me to stab unknown man.
That sounds very bizarre.
Serious_comma_ that has being my worse situation so far
I hope you are okay.
My car window was broken when i walked up to my car this morning!
That is so messed up!
Yeah it is! Im going to have to spend money I didnt have. Im so upset right now.
I hope this doesn't happen again.
I agree. I have never felt this frusterated in a long time! I should go for a walk
I really felt like a fool last night.
Oh my_comma_ what did you do_comma_ may I ask?
I was playing a board game with a few friends and I ended up spilling my entire drink all over the table.
That does not sound good. It must have been so embarrassing!
Work was not a good experience today.
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
I had to explain how a bunch of things work in front of a lot of people. I'm not a fan of talking in front of a crowd.
I hate public speaking too!
When i moved to dallas I felt I would have the time of my life after living in a small town_comma_ but after a couple of weeks i got homesick.
Dallas is a really fast city.
yeah it is. I dont know anybody and my classmates all have jobs. so I get to be at home by myself alot
I'm sorry_comma_ things will get better.
thank you. i wish i havd more friends here.
I'm really excited about this weekend!
What are your plans?
A friend of mine has been out of the country for a year and he has finally come back. We're going to catch up.
Thats aweosme! Is he going to be staying with you?
Yep_comma_ we have all weekend to hangout!
So my sister drove my car to run an errand and got a ticket! She doesnt have her license
That is terrible. What happened then?
Well not much. Its just I feel bad because I told her I would take her but got so busy. Maybe im the one that should have got the ticket. not her
I understand. My mistaske always happened.
I agree. Its my fault she will have this fine. I will have to pay it for her now .
Financial troubles are sometimes the worst! Ugh.
Those are so stressful. Just take it step by step and you can get on track.
You really have to. Luckily_comma_ my family was able to help me out and get me back on my feet. It's definitely nice to have people who are willing to help.
That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position.
so my brother will be the first out of 4 kids of my parents to have a baby and today is going to be the gender revealing party.
You must be really excited for it! Do you think its going to be girl or boy?
we all want a boy so we are all cant wait to find out what it is. everyone is so impatient about it_comma_ but today is the day.
Well_comma_ it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy!
I agree!. I cant wait to get there to find out. lol
I'm looking forward to how chill this weekend will be.
Do you plan do something this weekend?
Quite the opposite_comma_ really. I just paid all my bills and have not really any plans. Sometimes it's nice to just not have that stress and relax.
Yes. It is sometime nice to just rest at home.
So this year will be the first time I been to a haunted house. Im get scared easilty so Im kinda worried. I promised my friend I would go with her.
That sounds like fun Do you know who haunts it?
I dont know_comma_ but I feel I should not go_comma_ but again I promised my friend I would go. I dont know wha to do now.
Well_comma_ if you promised I would try to go. I'm sure it'll be fine.
I agree. I will think about it for now. I'm very scared something will happen so im debating.
Me and this girl have been dating for awhile now_comma_so I think Im going to ask her to be my girlfriend.
Nice! You must be pretty confident she will say yes.
Yes I agree. I feel that way about it. You know me too well.
I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.
Thank you. I hope she dont say no_comma_ but i can bet you she says yes.
My sister's cat got sick and had to be put down last week. Feels bad.
That sounds terrible. But hopefully it isnt suffering any more.
She had stomach cancer_comma_ so she was in a lot of pain. Definitely the right thing to do
I agree_comma_ just remember her for all the good memories.
I have a huge exam coming up tomorrow.
Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet you'll do great! What's the subject?
It's for a PC Architecture class. I'm feeling really good about it though since I studied really hard all week!
What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety.
There are maggots all over my building's garbage bin this morning. I got one on my arm when I walked by
That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?
They don't care. They live upstairs and are very dirty people. I'm moving as soon as I get a job!
I understand. The best thing is to move.
Coming home driving in the rain my car hydroplaned on the freeway!
That's awful! I'm always scared that's going to happen to me when it's raining
I agree and thank god I was the only car on the freeway _comma_ otherwise It would be a different story!
You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be
Yah im very thankful to be here right now! whew!
I'm amazed on how many people came to the parade considering the rain!
Really_comma_ where was this parade at? I'm in Missouri and it was absolutely pouring on Friday
I'm here down south and It has been pouring as well_comma_ but that didnt stop people from coming! Im shocked.
I usually don't let a little rain stop me unless it's ridiculous!
I agree! They even brougth their kids! its so baffling!
I just saw a commercial about the Rescue Animals. Everytime I see it it makes me so sad.
oh no. feeling empathy towards them just shows you're normal. There's a lot of people in your boat
Yea. It reminds me of my old dog that was a rescue. So many memories. I want to go get one actually.
whats preventing you?
I started nursing school and work full time_comma_ so I wont give much time to it. I want it to be a happy dog.
you sound too kind. You'd be a great dog mother/father!
Thank you! Im gonna have to not see them commercials anymore_comma_ otherwise I will cry
I love mystery boxes in games! Unfortunately I usually don't get anything good.
That sounds fun!  What are they exactly?
Almost any game that has an online component! Like right now I play The Secret World and it has mystery boxes.
It sounds like you really enjoy it!  Good for you!
So I will be going to see my mom after 2 years of not seeing her since starting school! I cant wait
How exciting! She must be thrilled too
Yes she is. We are all so excited to finally hang out! We have so much planned
I hope you guys have the best time!
Thank you! WE will make the best of it !
So the role I worked so hard for went to a person who could care less about the play!
That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?
I guess you can say that! What a day!
I hate it when stuff like that happens.
I agree. Maybe I will act like him next time.
Haha_comma_ nooooo... don't do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is.
Yeah your right. I will stick to my little envious rant and go about my day
Sounds like the best course to me :)
Once_comma_ I went camping with my family. We saw many animals and a beautiful creek. It was a happy time.
That sounds so great. Being in nature makes you feel so good.
It does! I really hope we get to go camping again this fall.
You should just make a plan and do it. It sounds like it is worthwhile.
We order Chinese food last. The order was completely wrong but the lady seemed very helpful when we called.
That sucks_comma_ sorry to hear that. Did you get a refund?
We didn't get a refund but they were able to fix the order. I was really craving Chinese!
Hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!
I ate a lot of my kid's Halloween candy. I told her the candy was old and I had to throw it away.
Did it taste good?
It was really good! She had a lot of candy. I was hoping she wouldn't notice some missing!
Did it taste good?
Yes it did!
two weeks back i celebrated my birthday and do you know what my office colleagues planed for me
Were you suprised that they did this for you?
yes and i am quiet happy that they also brought my wife who stays in london for party to surprise me
Wow! How happy you must be. I be that day brought you lost of excitement.
yes it took me with a surprise how well my colleagues planned for me
You must have great co workers. I bet your happy everyday you go to work
So my childhood dog died last week. My mother called me with the news.
oh so sad _comma_ what happened to it
He died of old age. He could barely walk so they put him down. Yeah pretty bad news. It made my day blue
it must must a very much hard time for you and your family
Yes it is. He is in a better place now.
yes _comma_ he be rest in peace
We went camping in the mountain. We did not know it was bear season. There were a lot of hunters and hunting dogs in the area. They were chasing the bears into one area
I would be so scared. I think I might have to leave. Did the bears bother anyone?
Luckily_comma_ the hunters kept them around a mile from camp. It was still very hard to sleep! We heard dogs barking at the bears all night!
Were you in a tent or a camper? I hope you kept your food locked up tightly.
We were in a tent and all of food was in a Yeti! I made sure everyone put their food away and burned leftovers in the fire.
Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.
We had a doberman for over 8 years. He passed away last spring. It was a hard time for our family.
Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family.
They are like having another child! I hope to have another doberman one day. They're really good dogs.
You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family.
That's a great idea!
last week i visited a restaurant and found a insect in the burger which i ordered
That's disgusting. What did you do about it?
i immediately raised an alarm about the issue and complained to store manager
Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!
yes they provided me a 100 dollar gift card too
We have homeschooled our daughter for the past 3 years. This year_comma_ she has decided to return to public school.
That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.
She did miss having a lot of friends. I hope she does well. She starts in 10 days!
Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.
This will be my last semester in college! I cant wait to finish.
Wow good job! SO close
THanks!. I get so happy everytime I think about it!
Thats a great accomplishment
I agree. My family will be proud of me!
Since I moved to dallas I have not met any friends. I go to work and school and just come home.
maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group
I agree. It gets boring at home alone with no one.
i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump
I agree. This weekend it is!
that should be fun. good luck!
My sister lives in Utah. We had planned for her to come visit but her work would not allow her to take the time off.
Aw that's annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?
I haven't yet. I would like to eventually. I'm hoping to see her soon
I'm sure it will work out! Not this time unfortunatly_comma_ but it will in the end
So I was out of town this weekend and lent my brother my car. I was hesitant at first_comma_ but I felt he would do good with it and take care of it.
Did he take care of it for you?
He did. I feel I can let him use it more often after this.
That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud.
Yes I am. I can know rest assure that he will do good.
My husband works very hard so that I can be a stay at home mom. It has allowed me the freedom to homeschool our daughter.
That's awesome_comma_ what does your hubster do?
He owns an auto repair shop. He works from sun up to sun down!
Wow_comma_ I admire his dedication! And you won't ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking!
That's is the number one perk of having a mechanic for a husband!
So my 1 year review at work is coming up and I feel its going to be good since I wokred so hard.
Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature_comma_ it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated
I agree. I think my raise will be good as well as the promotion I asked for.
Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them
Sounds like a plan! She has noticed my work _comma_ so im confident it will work out well.
My child sneaked in my room to get the Xbox controller while I was sleeping. The night before_comma_ I had grounded her.
Oh no_comma_ do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?
I think she thought she could play a few minutes of Minecraft and then return the controller before I woke up! I caught her getting into the drawer where I hid it.
I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.
My friend came to my house drunk and threw up everywhere.
Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?
Yes it was! I could not do nothing. She was in a raging fit. Ijust made she she went to sleep ok.
Man_comma_ you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!
I am! I'm more grossed out about it than anything!
My friends mother got diagnosed with cancer last month and its been hard on her.
So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity
Yeah. Shes my best friend_comma_ so I'm planning to go with her this weekend to see her mom. my heart breaks for her..
Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need. That is what friends are for
I agree! Thank you!
Last week I did a presentation at work and as I stood up I blew some gas!
oh no!! Did anyone notice? it's normal though_comma_ we all do that sometimes
Yes it was loud. I can feel my face turn red and the room getting quiet!
oh man... It happened to me before_comma_ i know how embarrassing it is.
Yes it was. Ugh!
So my little brother barely passed his finals to become a cop! I could not beleive it.
That's great that he passed though!  ARe you happy about it?
Im very happy_comma_ but all he do through school was party and never study. Im shocked.
Well at least he passed - that's great!
Yes it is. Im happy for him.!
We went to the library where they had an animal expert stop by for the kids. My daughter was able to answer most of his questions that other kids could not. It made me smile.
That is pretty neat actually. I wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.
You should check your local library. The ones in my area have tons of things_comma_ like a Lego club_comma_ for the local kids.
I will do that_comma_ i had no idea.
My dad died of cancer in 2012. That was really hard for me emotionally.
I'm really sorry to hear that.
Thank you. I was prepared_comma_ but it was still difficult.
I can't even imagine to be honest.
I hope you don't have to go through it for a long time.
I have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with.
It's always tough_comma_ even if someone is older.
I'm sure it will be different when it's a parent.
I have a performance review and potential promotion coming up in the next few weeks.
that's awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work?
I work as an accountant for a carpet cleaning company. There is a chance that I could be made a manager!
You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig
I just hired a new hotel inspector_comma_ he has very little experience but wants to learn. Scares me.
you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! That's good you gave him a chance
Yes_comma_ I need more staff member and he was very nice. But if he does a bad job I get fired.
i hope it won't happen!
In high school_comma_ I fell down the stairs in front of my crush. My face turned red and I ran away!
Oh no! Did he say anything about it?
He laughed at me. Looking back_comma_ I'm sure it was funny but in the moment_comma_ I could have died!
I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly_comma_ don't you!
Last night I won a gift card at Trivia night at the pub. Going shopping today.
Awesome! What are you planning on buying?
I've got a baby due in December so something for the baby or my wife. I never bother getting my self anything.
Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!
I found out my wife was dating someone else a year before we got married_comma_ we were together for 7 years at that point. Today I'm stressed!
Oh no that is crazy!
Yea_comma_ We have a baby due in December so I'm trying to not jump to any decisions to quickly.
Well I'm sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out.
Thanks_comma_ everything happens for a reason.
I woke up one morning to make a sandwich. The smell of the sandwich meat made me sick! I felt something was wrong and drove to the nearest store. I purchased a pregnancy test.
I hate those things_comma_ i try to not eat those at all.
I usually love eating sandwiches which is why I knew something just wasn't right! I was experiencing morning sickness!
I eat steak and shrimp.
I have a friend that will not stop talking about himself. He always wants to talk about his latest investments_comma_ the books he has read_comma_ and how much he knows about the places that he visits!
i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face.
I do too. It makes me not want to be around those types of people.
i wouldn't be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?
Exactly! I should really stop hanging out with him.
agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.
I am a big Taylor Swift friend!
I love Taylor Swift! She's talented and beautiful!
Yes I need to arrive at her concert tonight at  8!
How exciting for you! Have fun!
I know I studied well_comma_ but I can't stop worrying about it.
You have a test coming up?
Yes on Friday. It is the final.
Well I hope you do well! Good luck.
She had a lot  of friends that came.
That's interesting. What was she doing?
She had her birthday at Chuck E Cheese.
That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business.
I love to coupon but sometimes I feel like the cashiers aren't trained properly. They will look at the coupon for every detail and do not understand the language in the fine print.
Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.
I agree. It's not like the money will come out of their paycheck if something is wrong!
I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it
The cop said he was too old!
Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.
Too old to give him a ticket for reckless driving!
That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.
That's what I thought!
I played a game of poker with a friend who had no idea what he was doing. I won about $100 from him that night.
Oh no_comma_ he shouldn't have gambled.
You are probably right! I felt bad when I was spending the money. I hope he didn't really need it.
I would've too_comma_ but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.
This is very true!
Recently there have been a few break ins.
Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?
No_comma_ my neighbor did but that's close enough for me!
For real! Are you taking any precautions?
One time I saw a stray dog walking around a restaurant looking for food
Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?
It was outside a fried chicken chain restaurant
Okay_comma_ that makes more sense then to me.
We made sure to board up for the hurricane coming.
Where are you located ?
We are in Miami_comma_ Florida 1 mile from the beach. .
I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.
The cop said I will probably never find out who did it.
Who did what?
I wont find out who the person was that hit my car while I was sleeping.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!
My sons teacher isn't very nice to the young kindergartners.
Oh no! Why not?!
Not_comma_ sure_comma_ but she is not very nice at all.
I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!
I may never know who she was.
Never know who was?
The women that hit my car and left before the police came.
Wow that is aweful!
I agree. And the cop said I will probably have to pay for my own damage!
Near my house_comma_ there is an abandoned school that is said to be haunted. When I was a teenager_comma_ a group of friends and I decided to go check it out.
Oh wow_comma_ what happened?
When we pulled up_comma_ it was very spooky. I didn't even want to get out of the car! A few of my friends tried to get in but it was boarded up. I looked in the window and there was still writing on the chalkboards!
That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?
There are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing. We didn't see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!
I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!
My hair has always been long and I had been scared to have a short hair cut. Last December_comma_ I finally took the plunge and cut off all of my hair.
Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.
That's what I have discovered! I get a lot of compliments on it and I feel really good about myself when I go out!
Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!
I recently drove back to my hometown and went to the towns fair_comma_ it felt so nice reliving my childhood.
That's awesome_comma_ I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month_comma_ it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?
It was great_comma_ it didn't change much but it still has that 'soul' to it. Just felt great looking at it honestly.
Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair_comma_ was always fun.
When I was in high school_comma_ I dated a guy for almost a year. A few weeks before summer_comma_ he broke up with me and started seeing another girl.
You must have been sad and angry.
I was. I would get really mad when I saw them at lunch or after school together. I was my first experience with heart break.
Yes first heart brake is so hard_comma_ I feel for you_comma_ something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.
This was my first time winning a contest on the raido!
That's awesome! Congratulations!
Thanks! I will get to go free to the Taylor Swift concert tonight!
No way! That's actually a super awesome prize! Have fun
I bought extra items during school lunch in high school. I have a negative balance on my account.
Ouch_comma_ hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it.
I had to take money out of my dad's wallet to cover it. I would have got in so much trouble with my parents for buying candy! It wasn't much but I still felt bad.
I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha_comma_ its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1.
I had a roommate in my dorm who didn't clean up his dorm room at the end of the semester and the school fined me and the other two roommates $100. I was furious at that guy.
Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.
Yeah we tried but he cut all communication_comma_ he didn't respond to his phone number or anything. I hope he got fined a larger amount so it teaches him a lesson on laziness.
I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate!
So i recently traveled to Cuba to see some friends and we went to a bar until 3 AM_comma_ and as we were walking back there were these 3 guys hiding in the shadows. We got so scared we started running but thankfully they didn't follow.
Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.
Yeah it was quite an experience_comma_ my friends said those are usually drunk people who stay up the whole night talking with people. But they looked like they wanted to do more than talk!
Well_comma_ at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been.
Its great_comma_ very beautiful and amazing culture (and food!). Just don't drive if you go_comma_ they seriously drive like maniacs haha
I raised 6 chickens since they were babies. I was trying to let them free range but I forgot to put them back in their coop for the night. A predator was able to get to them.
Oh no! That's sad_comma_ did he get them all?
Yes_comma_ it did! I think it was a dog that always gets out of our neighbor's yard.
Aw_comma_ that's too bad_comma_ hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!
I was looking through old clothes that i was giving away and found $40 in one of the back pockets. Made me very happy lol
wow_comma_ so what are you going to do with it?
Oh i just put it into a little piggy bank i have_comma_ trying to get to $220 to cop some yeezys that are coming out in october. Hope i get a pair!
nice_comma_ i hope that works out for you... good luck
I was watching youtube and saw this guy eat a jellyfish straight out of the ocean. Looked like the most disgusting thing someone could eat.
That is gross_comma_ I can't even imagine what that would taste like!
He said it had the texture of hard rubber and tasted of pure algae and just dead stuff. He even ate another one that he pan-fried and it was all green and moldy.
That's so gross_comma_ I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.
One of my friends jumped from the roof of his house to the pool and somehow made it_comma_ it was like 10+ feet of distance_comma_ really amazing stuff.
Omg_comma_ Thankfully he wasn't hurt.
Yeah i was really nervous that he was gonna get hurt since he likes to do stupid dares. It was quite the experience.
Did yall happen to get it on video?
No sadly_comma_ nobody had their phones with them at the moment. But theres plenty of videos on youtube showing what happens if you dont make it!
My older brother is getting married Friday.
Congrats!_comma_ I'm sure you must be very happy!
I am very happy for him! I thought it was never going to happen!
Haha brotherly love_comma_ I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!
Having a kid can be one of the most happy moments in a person's life. I cannot express how much happiness my daughter has brought to us since she was born.
thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day
It can be hard but it's one of the best experiences that I have had in life.
i bet so!
im nervous for the new week to begin
Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?
very busy and lots of traveling
That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away!
I spent 10 minutes looking for my car keys while my friends waited outside and they were in my pockets the whole time. My friends made sure i never forgot that moment haha
We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!
Oh thankfully i've never had to go through that yet. That one would really suck!
Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.
I told her I had to work because I didn't want to go see a movie tonight.
Did you not want to go out_comma_ or did you just not like the movie?
I was tired and wanted to get in bed early_comma_
Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress_comma_ it may be the stress talking and not you.
Had my finals last week_comma_ studied really hard for them. Felt so nice walking into that room so confident and calm
Great_comma_ when will you know your scores?
Thankfully i knew them right at the spot_comma_ i got a 98!
Wow_comma_ that's fantastic.
He doesn;t seem to see the issue.
Who doesn't?
My husband doesn't see flirting with girls a problem.
What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!
I studied all week for my math finals and only scraped a 68 on it.
That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?
Yeah_comma_ passed with a 75_comma_ not what i wanted but at least i passed
Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.
i dropped my groceries in the parking lot
Oh no_comma_ how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).
i grabbed the cans that rolled away_comma_ lol
Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once_comma_ which rolled under the car. I was livid!
One of my roommates left without cleaning his room and the school charged me and my roommates 100$ each
That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.
Yeah thats what we told them but they showed us the paper saying that its one of the rules. We were so furious at that guy_comma_ worst thing is he never responded to our calls or texts. Really immature and selfish of him.
Well_comma_ I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows_comma_ how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?
A restaurant that I wanted to eat at had "call ahead seating" where you can call and get placed on a waiting list. I called ahead and was told we would have a table in 10 minutes. When we arrived 10 minutes later_comma_ our table was not ready!
That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.
That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.
Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.
The food made it worth the wait_comma_ for sure! Any other restaurant I would have walked out!
We had a new puppy. He loved to chew on everything. I went to the grocery store and when I got back home_comma_ the puppy had pulled the cushions off of the couch. He had chewed through the bottom!!
Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time_comma_ but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.
They do! I'm really glad that that stage didn't last too long in him. I just hated having to buy an entire new living room suite! Puppies are expensive.
Yeah_comma_ that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it_comma_ but on that day I wouldn't be so sure_comma_ haha.
I accidentally dropped my phone at the screen started to glitch out and didn't want to turn on anymore. I was scared because it was a brand new phone. Thankfully after a while of it just sitting there it turned back on normally.
That is a huge blessing_comma_ I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.
Same here_comma_ they're so incredibly important in this day and age.
It's almost a shame how much we depend on them_comma_ but I know I'd be lost without mine.
i am bothered by my neighbors loud power tools next door
Do they run them all day long - or at night?
during the morning and day on the weekends!
Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm_comma_ there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.
My best friends invited me to a camping trip but I was a little anxious about the whole thing.
I don't blame  you because I hate camping.
Really? I was just really scared of getting bitten by a tick. I ended up enjoying the trip in the end!
Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.
i was blown away by how great my friends were this weekend
What happened?
they were very supportive and kind _comma_ helping me with some moving things
You are lucky to have such great friends!
A few weeks ago I was drinking with some friends at a park and I sliced my hand open while trying to rip a beer can in two.
oh that sucks_comma_ i hope it has healed since then
It has! The cut was so deep and I was bleeding so much I was scared of passing out from blood loss.
ouch_comma_ that sounds awful
Moral of the story: don't rip open cans with your hands!
i was shocked how nice the weather was this morning
How come? Have you had awful weather lately?
not really but it was just especially nice this morning
Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!
I decided to move to be with my boyfriend.
Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!
I did_comma_ but I had to leave all my family behind
Aw_comma_ but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life_comma_ after all
im mad at my neighbor today
Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?
he was using powertools loud in the morning
How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.
Last Christmas_comma_ I saved up a lot of money and was able to buy my family and girlfriend really nice gifts.
thats awesome_comma_ i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them
Me too! The act of giving makes me feel so warm and happy.
me too!
The teacher I had for Calculus 2 last semester was so terrible at his job_comma_ I had to learn it all on my own.
I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.
Same here. Surprisingly_comma_ I was able to pass the course and I felt so good about myself!
Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.
i felt happy this morning because it was sunny and warm
That's always a great start to a day.
absolutely_comma_ i was overjoyed
How are you celebrating it?
I have a big exam coming up tomorrow.
Oh wow. What's the exam on?
It's on PC Architecture. I'm feeling pretty good about it though. I studied really hard all week.
That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.
On my way back from a funeral_comma_ my friends and I almost got into a deadly car crash.
Oh no_comma_ what happened?
I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere_comma_ he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.
Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.
Agreed. I was so scared we could have been the ones in a casket that night.
I was so happy that after many years in retail I found a better job.
Congratulations! Retail really does suck.
Yeah it does. It really made me dislike people a lot.
Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.
Do you ever hear an album and it brings you back to when you first listened to it?
Oh_comma_ all the time. What album is that for you?
I just listened to a Billy Talent album again the other day and it brought me back to high school and reminded me of the person who showed me them.
I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.
A while back_comma_ my older sister stole my younger brother's iPod touch to sell.
That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?
No idea. All I know is that I was furious_comma_ especially seeing as my brother is the sweetest most innocent kid ever.
I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.
Last night was quite a bummer.
I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?
I was planning on going to a concert but ended up not going at the last minute because I didn't want to go by myself. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.
That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.
After working for a week straight and running a lot of errands_comma_ today is my first day off in a while.
That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?
It is_comma_ I'm super happy. Currently playing some Zelda on the Switch_comma_ it couldn't get any better than this!
Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.
I highly recommend it. I can't put it down.
My older brother always makes promises he can't keep.
That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.
I don't know why. Recently we were supposed to go out for sushi lunch together_comma_ but he keeps postponing it. I'll ask him for a definitive day.
I hope he doesn't let you down.
I'm so happy for my brother!
Something good happen to him recently?
He just graduated from college. He put in so much work.
That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.
My little brother failed his French class and had to spend three weeks in summer school.
Oh no_comma_ that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!
French is a really hard language_comma_ I have trouble too so it really hurt my heart seeing him go to school while all his friends and siblings were having fun without him.
Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.
My boyfriend's brothers got into a fist fight one night and he jumped in the middle.
That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?
Some things got broke and there were some bruises_comma_ but it was really scary to watch that.
I bet. I would've hid under the table.
i am blessed to have a great family
That's nice. Why do you say that?
they're just the best and always very helpful
That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.
Whenever my sister in law plans things_comma_ she only does it around her schedule.
That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?
Yeah_comma_ but she says she tries her best and thinks she is doing what is best for everyone. However_comma_ we are the only ones with kids on a schedule.
Well_comma_ at least that's the case. People can only do so much.
This weekend was kind of a drag.
Oh yeah? Why is that?
I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.
Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?
I was feeling quite social_comma_ though_comma_ so it was kind of a buzzkill.
The vacations I used to take when I was younger with my family have been on mind lately.
Are the good memories at least?
Oh yeah_comma_ but it really makes me miss those times.
At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!
I'm looking forward to this new game.
Which one?
The new Spyro Remastered. It really makes feel think back to when I used to play the original with an old friend of mine.
I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?
It comes out next month!
I told my sister in law that I would help her with her books. After this last one_comma_ I felt bad because I told her I couldn't anymore.
That's rough. Why can't you help her?
I just have too much going on now with two kids_comma_ and working from home.
Yeah_comma_ I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.
I saw some person eat like 30 hamburgers in Mcdonalds
How long did it take them?
I think he was making a Youtube video so he was eating very fast_comma_ so like 10 minutes
He must of been sick after.
One time I bought emergency supplies before a hurricane
That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time
Yup_comma_ people started charging like $5 per bottle of water
Wow_comma_ thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal
I just got some frustrating news the other day.
What was the news?
My son got caught cheating on a test. I really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are.
Are you going to ground him?
Definitely at least going to have a long talk about why what he did was wrong. There will be some kind of punishment that's for sure.
My sister in law and her fiance are always taking trips abroad and we hardly ever go anywhere.
Why don't you join them?
We definitely don't have money for that_comma_ plus there are four of us.
Why don't you get another job?
Ugh. I got some awful news the other day.
That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?
I got news that my grandfather passed away. He was old but no one saw it coming.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.
Hi there was a time that I was scared out of my mind I came home and my front door was unlocked and the lights were on in the house
Holy cow.  Was anything missing?
no and that was the weird thing nothing was taken
Had they gone through anything?
We recently celebrated my son's birthday_comma_ and had a big party.
oh yeah that must have been a good time
It was! He got a lot of cool toys_comma_ and ate a bunch of ice cream.
Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it
As he opened gifts_comma_ he told people thank you_comma_ and told them thanks for coming when they left.  I was pretty proud of our 4 year-old.
Next month my wife and I will take our first vacation since we got married.
that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation_comma_ where do you have planned to go?
We are going to Hawaii for a whole week. We have saved a long time to be able to afford this_comma_ I can barely wait till next month.
That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck
Do you feel when you see your mom after a long time
I miss her. You haven't seen your mom in a long time?
Why! what is the reason
I'm sorry_comma_ but I can't understand what you're saying.
Are you were near to your mom
Last year_comma_ during the spring_comma_ extremely heavy rainfall caused our basement to become flooded.
Oh man! I have been there_comma_ I hope you didn't have anything special down there??
I lost all of my childhood photos and many of my childhood toys and things I had saved_comma_ my bible from my late grandmother being one of the items.
Oh lord_comma_ i am so sorry! I have been there_comma_ that is hard!
Last week_comma_ my coworkers all got together and threw me at party for my 20th anniversary at work.
taht sounds like fun_comma_ i wish i had coworkers that nice ahahah. did you enjoy the party?
Yes_comma_ it was great. I had no idea it was even happening_comma_ they are so sneaky.
ahahaah seems to be they really like you working threre
I took my dog to the vet yesterday... it turns out that he's really sick.
Aww_comma_ I'm sorry.  Is he going to be ok?
It's not looking too good. I really hope he pulls through.
I do too.  That's one of the saddest things.  I hope you'll be OK too.
I was working on a project in this past week_comma_ couldn't find it locally_comma_ so ended up ordering it online.
wow nice
Not really_comma_ it still hasn't shown up!  I'm pretty annoyed!
ooops sorry to hear that
It's not that big of a deal_comma_ but I was really looking forward to finishing the project.
I saw a deer get hit by a car yesterday.
oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?
It wasn't dead_comma_ It was injured and moved to the brush on the side of the road. it was upsetting.
yea you never like to see stuff like that.
I opened up my mailbox this morning and there was a 10 dollar bill just sitting there inside!
did you try to find its owner?
I asked my neighbors about it_comma_ no one knew anything about it. I guess it was left there intentionally.
well that was nice of someone
A co-worker I've been working on a project with has been late
That's annoying_comma_ are you going to talk to them about it?
I plan on doing that_comma_ it's pretty disruptive
I hope it all works out in the end.
I just finished a major project at work for a client
Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?
Not at the moment_comma_ but I'm praying my supervisor and client likes it
I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!
I have an appointment for tomorrow. I'm hoping the same thing.
What is the appointment for?
My cat hasn't been feeling well this past week_comma_ I think there might be something really wrong.
Let's hope not! My prayers are with her.
I know. I'm so worried.
Thank you. I hope it's something that he will get over soon.
You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.
5
I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.
My child needs to start going to bed early to prep for school. Last night_comma_ I caught her sneaking her phone and watching tv at 12am.
Oh man_comma_ sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first_comma_ but getting to bed early will help with her future.
I've tried to explain that to her. It's like it goes in one ear and out the other. It bugs me.
Well yea_comma_ they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet.
A group of coworkers who play the same lottery numbers every week won $100_comma_000 on the pick 6 last week.
that is so lucky_comma_ they must be so happy they bought that ticket
They had asked me if I wanted to go in with them_comma_ and I said no. I regret that now_comma_ I could have really used a share of that money.
i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha
I studied really had so I am sure I will pass my test!
What kind of test is it
It was my science final for college.
Oh I hope you do well then
My friend went on a 14 day cruise to Europe. I wish that could have been me!
wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long
Right? Talk about ultimate relaxation!
yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say
My son is supposed to be sending me some money...
that is really nice of him_comma_ how much time will you have to wait?
Hopefully not too much longer. I've been waiting for a few days now.
well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction
I am scared of another hurricane coming through Florida. I had a bad experience last year.
that is horrible_comma_ natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them
No_comma_ all you can do is try to prepare. Do you live anywhere where there is threat of natural disasters?
not really_comma_ the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm
When my son was born it felt like I had everything I needed in life.
I bet that was a wonderful day
It really was_comma_ my life finally felt complete.
I am very happy for you
I got passed over for a promotion at work last week_comma_ even thought I had more experience than the other applicants.
that is not good_comma_ have you expressed your feelings to your boss?
I did_comma_ and it looks like I may be looking for a new job soon as they want to take the company in a new direction.
well i hope everything goes well for you_comma_ you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry
I remember when I started my first office job out of college. I was nervous because I didn't know what to expect.
It's a whole new world when that happens_comma_ I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?
I just tried to keep an open mind and go with the flow. It was hard to get used to sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day_comma_ but I soon got used to it.
It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.
I agree. And if it doesn't work out_comma_ you can always move on to something different.
I found some mold growing out in the garage
Oh no_comma_ that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?
I ended up cleaning it myself_comma_ I think I got most of it out
May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.
I was thinking about when we finally got to go pick up Rodimus after all that waiting!  I've never been so excited in my life.
what is that?
It's our Rotty pup! Sorry haha
oh that explains it!
Yes!  We had been waiting forever to find just the right breeder and then we found him oh my gosh.  That felt like the longest week of my life!
I saw a child ask for a candy bar that the grocery store yesterday. The mother spanked the child in front over every one in the line!
Wow when the child just asked?!
Yes! It was awful! Luckily the man behind her spoke up. I could tell she was embarrassed but I was furious at her!
I'm only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.
I agree. I hate seeing kids having to live in that type of situation. some people shouldn't be parents
One time I saw someone's dog pooping in my lawn and they didn't pick it up!
OMG that's so gross!
Yes_comma_ I wanted to throw it back at them!
That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way_comma_ after all.
I used the bathroom at Walmart the other day. I walked around the store for about 30 minutes before I realized I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe!!!
Oh god. That's kinda gross.
I felt gross hahaha I kicked it off of my shoe and stuffed it under a rack. I hope know one saw.
Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.
hahaha hope they wear gloves!
My son just started a new school.  The communication with them has been terrible!
Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?
I sometimes find out but it seems so disorganized!
That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!
We went to the lagoon a few weeks ago. My friends dared me to jump off of the highest cliff into the water.
Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada_comma_ who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?
That was what I was worried about! I ended up not jumping off of the highest one. I was too scared. I did jump off of the smallest one. That was really fun!
You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast!
I have a test coming up in one of my classes this week.
Do you feel ready for it?
Oh yeah_comma_ I'm definitely ready. I know I'm going to pass.
Awesome_comma_ hope it goes as planned!
I had about 6 or 7 hummingbirds in my yard the other day feeding.
Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?
No. my camera isn't good enough to get good pictures_comma_ they are so small.
Awww...that's a bit disappointing_comma_ but really cool that you got to see them!
I was trying to buy a piece of property that came up on the market_comma_ but someone put in a bid before I got a chance and it has already sold.
The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.
It is a piece of property that my grandfather owned and I pretty much grew up on_comma_ I would have really liked to have owned it.
That would have been awesome if you got it.
I worked for weeks on a presentation for work. I practiced over and over. I felt relaxed the morning of.
That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.
You are right! I was really proud of it! I'm glad I worked so hard on it. It lessened the anxiety that I usually have!
Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking_comma_ so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.
I was under the impression that my friends would pay me back.
What did they do to you?
They owed me money but never paid me back. I suppose it's not a huge deal though.
It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.
I worked with daughter for months with learning her multiplication tables. We've practiced and practiced and she still doesn't know them all!
I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once!
We homeschool too! I hope she can get them soon! It will make this year's math so much easier!
That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha
I'm going on a hiking trip soon
Do you hike very often?
Here and there when I have time
I've never been hiking_comma_ really! I'd like to go some day.
I scrapbook pictures of my son and I am a few years behind!
Oh_comma_ such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!
My son just started school all day_comma_ so I plan to start scrapbooking.  I don't use Stamp It Up though.
Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.
This past weekend_comma_ my cat Sam passed away_comma_ he was 17 years old.
So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.
Yeah_comma_it's been really strange the past few days without him asleep on my feet while I work.
May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.
I have nothing to complain about. Life is good.
That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.
No point in being a pessimist.
Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!
I baked a cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out to be so delicious! He was so excited.
Mmm_comma_ now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?
Black forest cake! It happens to be both our favorite kind of cake. I made it from scratch. What's your favorite cake?
Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet_comma_ but black forest is amazing too!
I felt so bad when I had to board my dog while I was on vacation. It made me feel like a bad dog mom!
Aww_comma_ I know that can be hard_comma_ but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.
I know. She was so excited when we came home though which made us feel a bit better.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
I'm happy with the person that I grew up to be.
What are some of your best traits?
I'm healthy!
Do you exercise often?
So we finally found the perfect Rotty breeder and we got to pick up our puppy this week!
Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha_comma_ and even if you did_comma_ dogs are worth it.
No he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  He is sooooo sweet!  I am so happy
Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way_comma_ I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.
Thank you!  We are so excited!
I love going to Disney World. It makes me remember all the wonderful memories I made there as a child.
I've never been_comma_ but it looks like so much fun.
It is a great place for both kids and adults! I don't have any kids yet_comma_ but can't wait to bring mine when I have them someday.
It would be so much fun to go there as a family.
Sometimes when I am out in public_comma_ my son throws a tantrum.
Oh yeah I am right there with you_comma_ I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2
Mine is 5.  Every now and then_comma_ he says a curse word_comma_ uses it properly too!
They are too smart for their own good
I was just about to make a sandwich to eat_comma_ when I discovered something really gross.
what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread
No_comma_ there weren't any bugs. But there was mold.
ewwww_comma_ so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it
The head of marketing at my job recently dumped a bunch of new tasks on me and my coworker. I feel like she's just lazy and making us do her job.
or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks
Ha_comma_ that's a really nice way of looking at it but nah I'm pretty sure it's mostly laziness.
did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel
I thought about it but no_comma_ it's not worth rocking the boat. If she tries to pull that again and dump even more on us_comma_ then I'll probably say something.
I can't believe this!  Some kid at the gas station nearly hit me and then had the nerve to call me awful names!
Did you call the police?
No!  I got so flustered and kind of paniked.
Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty
Guess what!  I nailed my review for this year and got a raise!
That's great! I'm so happy for you!
Thank you! I worked so hard and I am so freaking excited!  I am also up for a promotion if we keep growing!
Ooh_comma_ will you be managing anyone?
I freaking dropped my coffee on the ground this morning
I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?
Yes.  And to make it even worse I soaked myself!
Ugh! Were you away from home?
Right outside the office and with no spare clothes!
My stepdaughter graduated from college in May and got a job in San Francisco making 3 times more than I have ever made.
Oh wow_comma_ she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you_comma_ but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her.
I'm definitely proud! It doesn't feel bad at all. I'm so happy about how much drive she has to succeed.
Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her_comma_ I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!
I'm maybe a little jealous_comma_ but I know how hard she works and how smart she has been with her decisions.
Whew. I finally got all of my work done for the day.
That is a good feeling!
It really is! Now I can go home and just relax for the rest of the evening.
Nice! No kids at home?
Nope_comma_ just me. So it's nice and quiet.
I am so nervous.  I have to go to the dentist tomorrow to get a filling replaced.
Are you afraid of the dentist?
I am!  I had a bad experience with one when I was younger.
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck_comma_ I'm sure everything will be just fine.
I spoke at a conference recently. I was a little scared going into it but felt great as I knew I knew my speech.
Oh nice! That's super brave of you.
I'm actually one of those fortunate people who doesn't have a fear of public speaking.
That's a great skill to have!
I was cleaning out my attic and found a box full of old photo albums. I spent the next few hours looking at old photos and having a great time.
That must have been a nice feeling.
It really was. I miss a lot of the people in the photos_comma_ made me really smile to see their faces again.
I love that nostalgic feeling.
I am so irritated.  My dog keeps trying to eat up my shoes no matter where I put them!
Haha_comma_ sounds like my pupper_comma_ is she still young?
Yeah she's only about six months.  Despite all her chew toys its still my shoes she craves...
Right!? It's weird_comma_ you buy them all the toys in the world_comma_ but they still go after your stuff.
My husband works late at night and sometimes I'm stuck by myself.
Why he is working late?
He owns his own business working on cars. If something goes wrong_comma_ he is forced to stay to fix the issue.
I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?
That's a good idea! Maybe I can have a boardgame night or something!
My aunt just signed for my cousin to get an FJ Cruiser! That is my dream car! He doesn't even have a job.
Aww man that sucks for you
It does! Maybe he will at least let me drive it!
Hopefully! It is your dream car after all
I'm looking forward to visiting a friend over the weekend
That should be fun. Any big planes?
Nothing too big_comma_ probably just wander around town
That will be nice to catch up.
I'm so irritated at my neighbor. She moved out recently and left ALL her garbage and old furniture in our parking lot by the garbage.
That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!
Not at all_comma_ that's what is so weird! She was really polite_comma_ quiet_comma_ and neat.
I wonder what could have changed? Either way_comma_ I'd be pretty pissed off.
I am! But whatever_comma_ nothing we can do but have the city come pick it up I guess.
Last week the plant I work at was hit with massive layoffs.
Oh no! That is terrible!
I was fortunate enough to be one of the very few who got to keep their job_comma_ I am happy but very sad for the others.
I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!
Two years ago my wife and I got divorced. It has been very odd in this big house all by myself.
How do you feel these days?
It has gotten a little better with time_comma_ but still a pretty sore spot for me.
It must be difficult_comma_ do you think she will come back ever?
I lost my job earlier this year. I was really worried about how to pay my bills and finding a new job.
Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?
Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company_comma_ no less. So everything worked out!
Wow! That's like a paid vacation!
Haha that's an awesome way to think about it!
Last week a friend of mine won $2000 on a scratch off ticket. I buy those things all the time and never win squat.
Wow_comma_ that's incredible. What's their secret?
Right place_comma_ right time I guess. Some people are just lucky.
Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!
My niece got sent home from school yesterday with that stomach bug that's going around
That's unfortunate_comma_ hope you don't get it as well!
I know!  I've been pretty worried about her.  She's such a tiny thing.
I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time.
My phone went missing. Imagine my surprise when I got a Facebook message "from myself_comma_" it was the person who found it saying "I have your phone."
Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?
I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.
You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.
Very! Lucky for me it was a cheap phone_comma_ I think if I had the newest iPhone or something I would have never seen it again.
I just got some new neighbors. I'm kinda nosy so I asked if I could take a look at how they decorated_comma_ just out of curiosity.
Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?
Nah_comma_ although I did consider brownies. They were happy to meet me so it was all good. But man I couldn't believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! I am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills.
Next time they let you in_comma_ just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.
My kid was signing The Spice Girls a few years ago. She thought she had discovered a new band! She asked if I had ever heard of them before.
Yeah_comma_ they are cute like that. How old is she ?
She almost 11 now. She loves to listen to all of the bands from when I was younger. It's really cute.
I have a 10 year old like that.
My daughter practiced her gymnastics every day all summer. We just found out that she made the team!
that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding
It is! I cannot wait to see what's in store for her future! Maybe a scholarship!
that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.
thank you!
you are very welcome. good luck!
My grandma threw away my high school yearbooks.
That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!
I don't think she realized what they were. I was pretty irritated as they can't be replaced but what can you do?
Yeah_comma_ It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look.
Good suggestion! Really I wanted to keep all the signatures and notes from my friends but oh well. I will see them next month for our reunion anyway!
We've had our dog for over 8 years. He past away this spring.
I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February_comma_ so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?
It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter
I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing_comma_ so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped_comma_ something to think about at least.
I completely agree. I broke down just watching her cry at the spot where we buried him. I'm not sure if I want to get another dog yet. We have chickens so she's began to show them more attention now.
I bought my daughter her first cell phone. It's a lot of responsibility for her. I hope she is ready for it.
I am sure she will be smart with it
I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone
You can always show her the ways
This is true! I also put an app on her phone to block things she's not old enough to use
I accidentally knocked over a little kid coming out of the store the other day.
Were they okay?
Yeah thankfully he was totally fine. But I felt so bad.
At least you're not getting sued
Oh man_comma_ that would be terrible. Way to look on the bright side!
Im good at that lol
I'm going skydiving this weekend. My stomach all ready hurts with fear.
Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.
This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared
I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.
Have you ever went. When you looking down from 15_comma_000 feet you get scared.
We moved into a 200 year old house. There are creeks and cracks that creep me out!
I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?
Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up_comma_ it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.
I am not sure I would do well in that house
It is really creepy!
After my mom passed away I found all our old cassette tapes in her storage_comma_ listening to those was pretty cool.
Bet that brought back good memories.
Definitely_comma_ brought me right back to the road trips we took when I was younger.
Where did you guys usually go?
Everywhere! Sometimes we just hopped in the car and went like two or three hours from home just to do something for the day.
I've spent all day getting my kit ready for the next competition this weekend. I'm exhausted.
whats the competition on ?
Highland games. I throw the caber and heavy hammer.
Nice hope you win _comma_ ill be looking into this further
I'm so angry at my self. I was in my performance review today and I passed wind in front of my boss. OMG
I wonder how that was noted on your report.
I got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting. I've heard her rip one in the past so I guess no judgement.
Sounds like a wacky place to work.
I got a raise today. I've pushed my self hard this last year and I deserve it.
That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.
Thanks it's been a rough year. My hours were cut but I was expected to keep up the same work load. Thanks again!
Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.
For the last few nights I've heard weird sounds outside my bedroom window.
Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?
I don't think so_comma_ it doesn't sound like any animal I recognize. It's really creepy.
I hope it's not a crazy person or worse_comma_ an alien waiting to abduct you!
I told my daughter she wasn't allowed to watch Youtube because it's hard to monitor. I caught her sneaking and watching videos last night!
Its so hard to monitor that stuff now
It is! There's also a ton of weird stuff on there that's labeled for kids.
Yeah_comma_ that is a scary thing to think about too
I walk my dog for 30 minutes at a time but no matter what_comma_ he always ends up using the bathroom inside! I wish he would left me know if he needs to go out.
On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?
No! He's about 2 years old now. Sometimes I think he does it out a spite when he's not getting enough attention!
Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.
That's not a bad idea!
My neighbor stole a package from me.
No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.
So check this out_comma_ I ordered a planter for my porch. That's how I know he did it_comma_ the exact planter I ordered and never got appeared on HIS porch a few days after my package went missing!
Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.
Yeah_comma_ I'm pretty livid. I think I will report him to our HOA and see what they say.
I moved to northern Alaska last year and don't know anyone.
you havent met all three people in the city yet?
haha. I live about 1 hour south of Barrow the most northern place in the USA and about 12 hours north of any actual city.
ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head
It's the most beautiful place you can move just no one here. Me and the animals.
My coworker was able to find a new job after only looking for like a week.
What kind of job was it
Sales_comma_ so I'm not really envious about that part as I'm not into sales but I was still upset that he found a job so easily and I couldn't. We both wanted out of that company so bad.
Sales do sound hard to do
My cat got sick the other day_comma_ he was really pathetic. I felt so bad for him.
Is he going to be okay
Yes_comma_ thankfully! The vet gave him some fluids and I made sure he got some food in him. He's doing much better today.
I am glad then_comma_ I hate to see pets in pain
My friend is a single mom who works full time. She just graduated college!
That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.
Right? I'm so proud of her. Her accomplishment really made me think about just how lazy I am in my own life haha
Hahahaha_comma_ it's hard to compare yourself with that_comma_ but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.
I think I got my coworker in trouble.
Why? Were they not working?
He called in sick_comma_ but spent the day at the waterpark with his kids. I didn't realize he'd called in sick_comma_ I thought he was just out. So_comma_ I accidentally told my boss where he was.
He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.
Thanks_comma_ that's a good point. Or at least let me know he's going to lie so I can cover for him!
Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?
Saturday I'm climbing Mt. Elbert the highest Mountain in the lower 48. The nerves has started to set in.
That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?
Not so much any more that I moved to the east coast. I do more surfing now but I was able to get off work so I fly into Colorado Thursday.
Wow_comma_ so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!
Drove past the area my Middle school was in today. It was gone. I hated it when I was in school but now that's it gone I'm sad
yea funny how that happens
It was not even that long ago I went to that school. It's been less then 10 years. They did not even build anything. It's a park now.
well at least its being put to good use
I'm going to job interview Thursday. I'm currently employed but I'm ready to move on.
Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?
Yes_comma_ I'm currently in middle management this would be the next step up. I'm excited and nervous
Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?
My cousin passed the CPA exam!
Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?
She's already working at a Big 4 firm so she's just going to stick with that for a few years. I'm proud of her_comma_ it wasn't easy!
Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.
I just got a new manager at work. She is really young but seems to be full of good ideals.
That's cool!  Maybe you'll get along great!
I plan to steer clear. I'm going to relocate in January so I just need to lay low. I hope she does a great job.
lol why do you have to steer clear?
I'm not looking to make a good or bad impression. I just want to do my job and go home.
ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!
The other weekend I really wanted to go out_comma_ but I realized I don't have any good friends left.
That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?
Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends.
Yeah_comma_ that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league_comma_ that's what I did.
The other day I was short on cash I needed to pay my phone bill.
It can be hard these days_comma_ money is tight
So true. I lucked out though and found a $20 bill on the ground! I hope the person who lost it didn't need it really bad because it definitely helped me out.
I bet that was a nice surprise
I lost my credit card this weekend and then in the worst place Walmart.
Did you get it all straightened out?
Yes I was very stun someone did a good deed and turned it in with my wallet and all the money in it I was very grateful.
Wow that is awesome_comma_ too rare in these times_comma_ count your lucky stars!
My oldest daughter started elementary school today I was so glad she had a great first day.
Oh wonderful!  I'm glad it went so well!  Did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?
A new school that's why I was kind of nervous and scared but she loved it.
Oh boy_comma_ I bet you were nervous.  I would've been too!  Sounds like she's got a great and fun year ahead of her!
My neighbor keeps letting her dog use the bathroom on her balcony.
That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?
It's revolting. I reported her to the HOA but she keeps doing it. I'm going to say something if I catch her out there letting her dog out.
I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!
The other day I made fish tacos and did nothing else all day but relax on the couch.
Bet that was a nice calming down.
Very. It was nice and chill and low pressure_comma_ just how I like it.
Did you get up to anything else fun?
Not doing anything WAS my idea of fun!
I did a walk a thon last week for back to school drive and needy kids it was s long walk but I finished it I felt so happy.
That sounds awesome_comma_ i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.
I did before the walk I was un-assured I would finish but I did so I was overly proud and it was a great cause that raised lots of money.
Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!
Went out to eat with my boyfriend the other day. Saw our waiter pick his nose and wipe it on his shirt.
Oh gross_comma_ I would lose my appetite
It really was gross. I was so grossed out I asked to get moved to the bar so we could get a different server.
Yeah_comma_ I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether
I am so scared of snakes there was one in my back yard a few weeks ago.
Oh my goodness_comma_ that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?
When I looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but I'm still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones.
They can still bite_comma_ so it's better safe than sorry.  My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.
I will stay clear of them all not taking any chances.
I'm a neat freak and my house has to stay clean and in place always such a pet peeve of mines.
Do you have OCD?
Very bad and when my family has the house out of place I become so furious I just like things clean and in order.
I just love when the house is clean_comma_ makes you feel good.
Yes and so relaxed and peaceful.
My supervisor totally stole all the credit for a client I brought in.
That's a bad supervisor. Did you call him/her out on it?
I totally did. And let the CEO know about his behavior.
I hope he got in trouble!
Unfortunately no_comma_ the CEO thinks he can do no wrong. Eventually he'll figure out what a jerk he is.
I start back college next week I can't wait to finish getting my degree for me and my family.
Oh most are dreading going back to school. What's your major?
I'm going for nursing and I have dreaded going back for 6 years now but my support system pushed me to follow my dream I'm thankful to have them.
Nursing can be difficult_comma_ but if you have determination and a good support system_comma_ I'm sure you'll do great!
It is but I know the hard work will pay off in the end.
I recently applied for a promotion at work.
How'd it go?
I didn't get it.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope another opportunity comes up.
Me_comma_ too.  Then I found out someone else less qualified got it.
I'm shopping for a new bicycle! Can't wait to pick one out.
That sounds like fun!  Are you big into biking?
I have been recently_comma_ yes. I'm using an old beat up hand-me-down mountain bike so getting the right bike for me is going to be so much fun.
Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike
The crime rate in my city is so high right now it breaks my heart and things need to change.
That's horrible. What can people do to change things?
First thing get the young crowd out the streets and take the weapons away a 7 year old passed this weekend because of this it is so heart breaking.
Yes! The weapons thing is so important.
Found out recently that one of my best friends from back home died in an accident.
Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that.
Thank you. I don't even have it in me to call her parents and offer my condolences yet_comma_ it's just too shocking.
I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.
I started my new job last week and already I feel part of the team.
That's great. Getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes.
It is and that's why I was nervous but the staff was so kind and open.
That sounds like a wonderful place. I'm kinda jealous hahaha.
Lol don't be let's just hope I can still say this in 3 months.
One time someone kicked my dog!
That's awful! What did you do?
Nothing! My dog was just walking passed him!
No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?
I got laid off from a job that I really used to love.
Woah that's really bad!! Is it due to cost cutting? They let you off.
Sort of_comma_ the company was being run into the ground by poor management. It hurt at first but then I realized just how much I'd started to hate the work and the company.
it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!
I can't believe I lost my phone today while running errands.
Oh no_comma_ that's the worst.
Sad part is I have no idea which store that's why I am so upset.
I hope you can get it back somehow!
I ended up on one of those "Top 40 under 40" lists for people in my profession. Felt pretty good.
That is an amazing accomplishment.  What field are you in?
Finance_comma_ basically_comma_ but it was a little broader than that. I wish my mom were still around_comma_ she would have been so happy.
I'm sure you know that she is so proud of you!  That is really incredible!  Congratulations!
Thank you!
I was shocked my husband bought me flowers today out of the blue.
That is so romantic.  They weren't for any occasion?
Nope not at all_comma_ that's why I was so shocked!
Were they your favorites?
I was so grossed out about the molded bread I bought today.
Oh yuck. Did you get a chance to return it to the store?
I tried to_comma_ but they had a no refund policy.
That's crazy! I'd leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you aren't out much money.
Seeing my kids face when I finally brought a puppy home was priceless!
Wow that must have been amazing!
It really was_comma_ and I got it on video too.
They're going to remember that forever
While my car was parked on the street in front of my house last week_comma_ someone ran into it and left a huge dent.
Dang_comma_ that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?
No_comma_ they didn't leave a insurance card or anything_comma_ just drove off. Some people are so worthless.
Yeah_comma_ that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?
Last month my dog Skippy passed away. He was 18 years old.
Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.
Man it's hard. He has been like my best friend since I was a teenager.
Oh_comma_ Did something happen to him?
My dog died of old age today.
I am sorry to hear that. Mine died of old age as well last month.
I am sorry that happened too. I never thought I would be this upset over a dog.
Me neither_comma_ but in the end_comma_ I really didn't think about him as a dog_comma_ he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this.
I waited the longest three weeks of my life to get something I ordered online.
That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?
It got worse. When it finally arrived_comma_ the box was all busted up and my item was broken. So yeah_comma_ safe to say they had a lot to make up for.
At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldn't use them again.
My husband has been getting on my nerves worrying about his football team losing.
I know the feeling. What team is he rooting for?
He is crazy about the Falcons.
I don't even know what team that is_comma_ haha. Football is lost on me.
I am also sure I fixed my computer today.
Oh that's good_comma_ last time my computer broke was a day before I left the country
That would be a nightmare! All I had to do was replace the fan.
I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins_comma_ just needed a hardware reset
My husband was just sent to Iraq and I already miss him so much.
Oh my goodness_comma_ is he with the armed forces?
Yes the army_comma_ he will be there for 2 years.
I cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier.  While I can't bring him home quicker_comma_ I do want to say thank you to you_comma_  him and your family for your sacrifice.
I am in shock ever since my house caught on fire while I was at work.
That is horrible_comma_ did anyone get hurt?
No_comma_ thank goodness no one was home_comma_ but their is nothing left of our house.
Hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay.
One time I heard a large knock on my door while I was sleeping
That is scary.  What was it?
It was a couple of drug addicts trying to come in!
Gosh It's worse than I thought it would be.  What did you do?

I hope things are better next time.
Today is my anniversary! My husband planned an amazing day! He bought me my favorite chocolates and is taking me to a concert tonight! I had no idea about the concert!
That's great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships!
He usually doesn't do this much! I guess after years of hinting_comma_ he's finally picking up on them! haha
Lol! Oh geez- so many take years to get it ugh! But at least he finally has! I hope he is very romantic too!
haha yeah it does! we've been together almost 15 years.
Congrats <3
I had my front door open and a cat (not mine) ran in my house.
Not yours? That is so weird_comma_ usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol
I know! we were all surprised. My god was going nuts and my cat hid under the couch while we chased the stray around trying to get it out.
Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers!
This has been the worst year ever for tornadoes in our area. This past spring we spent 5 hours in our basement due to all the tornadoes in our area.
That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though_comma_ it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!
Yes_comma_ a lot of people don't have basements_comma_ and that would be really bad. It's hard to explain to a three year old why you are in such a dark_comma_ scary place_comma_ especially when the power is all out.
Oh your right_comma_ I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!
I was in the grocery store. I found what I needed on the top shelf. I climbed onto the bottom shelf but ended up knocking everything down!
Oh my goodness_comma_ are you alright? I bet you created a mess!
yeah! The only thing that was hurt was my pride! I've never tried to check out so quickly!
I hope you can laugh a little about it now!
My favorite band is doing their last tour. My husband bought me tickets to see their concert! He surprised me with them today!

I know! I wasn't really planning to do much this year hahaha
Last month_comma_ my dog Duke passed away. I got him when he was just a puppy 17 years ago.
I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like_comma_ to me_comma_ that he lived a long life with you though_comma_ and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog
Yeah_comma_ we did everything together. I still have to stop myself from calling him when I go to bed at night. It's amazing how close we can get to our pets.
That's crazy_comma_ and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point
I was driving around my old neighborhood and seen that the house I grew up in had burned down.
That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?
I spent birth till I was 17 living there_comma_ so literally all of my child hood memories.
I'm so sorry :( At least you have your memories to look back on.
my wife got a flat tire on her way home from work and a man was kind enough to stop and help her change the tire.
That was really nice of him. I know that she had to be relieved.
As was I. I was about 50 miles away at the time and she was on the side of the highway.
Someone was watching over her.
Just over 2 years ago_comma_ my wife and I got divorced. It was so strange being in our big house all alone without her and the kids.
How long had you been married ?
Just short of 9 years. She met someone online in WoW of all places and just up and moved in with him.
Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.
Back when I was in college_comma_ I crossed a street in wrong place and got a ticket.
I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.
Exactly_comma_ especially when you get one for just walking.
Yeah_comma_ that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.
My wife and I are going to buy are very first brand new car this week.
Cool_comma_ what are you getting?
A Chevy Cruze. We have been working hard to get our credit score up to get a really good interest rate.
That's a nice car_comma_ you are going to enjoy it.
I took my three children camping recently_comma_ and we had a great time.
Neat! We took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago! Did ya'll build a fire?
Of course!  I have found that the key to a great camping experience is to have a checklist of what to bring_comma_ and follow it.
That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain
My daughter finally master the 1-6 times. We worked very hard on it this summer!
The 1-6 times as in multiplication?  Teaching children is so rewarding.

What grade is she in?
She is in 5th grade.

Awesome news!  What was the response?
Well_comma_ they decided not to hire me. This stinks.
Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!
My wife held a surprise birthday party for me. It was totally unexpected and I was shocked when I came home and so many people were there.
That's awesome_comma_ I bet you were overjoyed with it!
I couldn't believe that no one let the cat out of the bag. It must have been hard to plan.
You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you_comma_ that's true!
Last week during the night someone came into my yard and stole my push mower.
Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?
No_comma_ I called the police but it's almost impossible to track. I had to chained to a steel post_comma_ but they cut the chain with bolt cutters I guess. I sure hate thieves.
Yeah_comma_ thieves are terrible.  I mean_comma_ who would steal a mower?
My food had hair in it at a restaurant worst experience ever.
what did you do?
I called the manager over and they offered to redo the food and pay for it but I was so sicken and upset I said no thank you it ruined my whole appetite.
yea i can see that_comma_ it happens but it sucks
I'm not one to like scary movies that much only with my husband since he loves them so much.
well atleast you watch them with him! i dont like them either.
We watched the new movie IT I was a little frightened and creep out especially because I'm afraid of clowns lol.
Oh no_comma_ no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even.
My wife is going away on a business trip soon.... she'll be gone for a couple of weeks.
That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?
Well_comma_ I might do some work on the house. But it's going to be awfully quiet around here.
I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.
Ugh_comma_ my neighbor keeps playing his music really loud at night when I'm trying to sleep.
spray water over there
Ha_comma_ that's not a bad idea. I do need to have a word with him about it though at least.
thats good_comma_ you should
Someone at work keeps stealing my lunch from the fridge! So infuriating!
Could you get with your HR department to see if they can assist?
I might give that a try. But whoever did it had probably better hope that I don't find out who they are!
What would you do to them?
Well nothing too serious_comma_ but I'd definitely have a word or two with them!
I don't like the dark.
Yea_comma_ I used to hate it too.
I get so worried about something happening to me.
Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?
More of a human with intent to harm type fear.
I've been stuck for several weeks on a part in this video game I've been playing...
is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly
It's pretty tough. But it doesn't matter now... I let a friend of mine have a try_comma_ and he got through it right away! It was pretty impressive to see.
yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games
So the fiance managed to rewire one of the wall outlets yesterday!
That's pretty impressive_comma_ does he have any training or just all self taught?
A little bit of both!  I didn't know he had these skills but it was really neat to watch!
Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!
Ugh_comma_ my neighbor's dog just keeps barking all day long. It's driving me insane.
That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!
It really is. And I've talked to him a few times about it_comma_ but he doesn't seem to care at all.
I am sure he thinks it's his world_comma_ the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude
My brother is getting out of jail next week.
Well you must be happy about it.
Not really... I'm the one that turned him in. And I'm scared that he might know about that.
Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.
I have a Dr appointment tomorrow to make sure my cancer is still in remission.
I hope you hear good news.
I think I will. It's been 7 years since my last treatment. I still get nervous when I have my checkups though.
I understand. I guess you'll always feel that way.
My brother is supposed to be paying me back for the food I bought for him last week...
It was nice of you to buy him food_comma_ but I'm thinking he didn't pay you back.
Nope_comma_ I've been waiting for a few days_comma_ and I could really use that money now.
I'm sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it_comma_ and then you don't get it. I hope he pays you back soon.
I stepped out of my front door this morning... and right into an unpleasant surprise that my neighbor's dog left for me.
Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.
Yeah.... the smell was so bad. It took forever to get that off of my shoe.
Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.
I got a phone call from a friend that I haven't heard from in a really long time.
That's great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.
I was! It was so great hearing from her again.
I bet you had tons of catching up to do!
I have a meeting with my boss in a few hours...
The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?
See_comma_ that's the thing... I have no idea what to expect. That's why I'm so nervous about it.
Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be_comma_ then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you
My mother is getting very old. And she really isn't in great health these days...
That is unfortunate_comma_ my own mother was ill for several years_comma_ she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?
Yeah_comma_ I try to go see her at least twice a week. I'm not sure how much longer she'll be with us.
Just spend what time you can with her_comma_ I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.
When I was out of work my car broke down and since it was my only car a friend of mine actually gave me his old car to replace it. It was such a nice gesture.
That was great of him!
It was. I insisted that I pay him after I got a job but he wouldn't take the money.
He sounds very nice!
I finished a major work assignment in a short amount of time
Oh really what was the assignment
It was a presentation that had to be quickly put together.  My supervisor seemed pleased
It's always great to get back positive feedback!
I remember when the PS4 was first launching.  It was the first game console I ever ordered onilne and I was really looking forward to having it delivered.
What was it like when it showed up on your door?
I was watching the front door like a hawk_comma_ and constantly checking for online tracking updates.  I kept worrying that someone would steal it of my porch if I didn't get it right away.
Thats hilarious_comma_ You finally got it though uhuh?
Oh yeah.  As soon as I heard the knock I flung the door open and snatched it in a hurry.
A friend was supposed to meet me for lunch_comma_ but didn't show
Im sure they had a good excuse.
He said he was busy with work_comma_ so I suppose so
Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.
I accidentally left my phone at a restaurant
Oh crap! how long untill you realized?
A few minutes after leaving_comma_ I was able to get it back
Thats so good_comma_ man I have done that a time of two.
I'm sure I will pass my law exam.
I am sure you will as well. Confidence is great!
Thank you. I'm almost done with school!
Congratulations. You have done great!
A friend got a new car
That's really cool. What kind of car?
BMW_comma_ it was a model I had been looking to get myself
That  sounds like a really awesome car!
I carry around the ticket stub from the first concert I attended in my wallet.  It brings back good memories I had spending time with my friends.
Aww_comma_ that's really sweet and sentimental. I like that. Can you still read the words on it?
The edges are a little frayed but I can still make out everything on it.  I keep it in a zippered compartment to preserve it.  Maybe I'll frame it someday.
I was going to say_comma_ yeah_comma_ that's the kind of thing I would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office. How cool!
Yeah_comma_ it's a nice little souvenir to remind me of good times.  It was a great concert and experience for all of us.
Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.
We went to see Incubus_comma_ it was our favorite band going through high school.  I went with my best friends who I'm still best friends with_comma_ and they actually did keep theirs too.
Hey_comma_ the other day I didn't have a pen while trying to fill out some paperwork

Well you two have fun tonight.  I won't tell your parents about all this.
I got a new job and it is so great and I have my old supervisor to thank she's the best.
Why you need to thank her? Is she the one that helped you to find the new job?
She was a great influence and gave me words of encouragement to branch out and go for more then our company job.
She is very nice person. That is great.

I am so annoyed my neighbor's trash always ends up in my yard.
That is a big deal.  What are you going to do?
I have tried everything_comma_ but they keep doing it even after paying huge fines.
I would throw trash in their yard.
My husband has been on his second tour in Iraq. Seems like I wont see him in forever.
He sounds like a real hero though. I hope he comes home safe soon
Thank you_comma_ The kids and I miss him terribly.
I can only imagine. At least you have each other
I lost everything in the fire today.
Are you and your family okay?
We are thank heavens_comma_ but we lost everything.
I am sorry_comma_ you can replace it though
I once left all cash and didn't have any to pay for a metro ride_comma_ some random girl paid for me without saying a word.
Wow!  How kind is that!  Their really are kind people left in this world.  How did you respond?
Yes_comma_ and I am thankful for those kind of people.
*There* oops.  Did you ever find out her name?  Or find out a way to thank her?
Last week on the way to work_comma_ I did not notice my wife had ran my car so low on gas and I ended up running out of gas on the freeway.
On no! Did you have to walk_comma_ or did you call for service?
A nice man stopped_comma_ help me push my car to the shoulder and even had a can of gas he let me use in his trunk. Talk about a nice guy.
Wow_comma_ you got lucky! Did you give him a tip?
I got caught cheating on my test. I feel so horrible.
Why did you feel you had to cheat? I am sure you could have passed if you had studied.
I just wanted to make sure I passed. But now I have a big 0.
Well_comma_ don't let this one situation define you. Use it as a learning experience and move on_comma_ and do you best not to repeat it.
I had an accident today and I never want to show my face again at work.
That's so sad! What on earth happened?
I accidentally peed my pants when I was laughing.
Now that is quite embarrassing! What did your co-workers say?
They all laughed and posted it on facebook.
My daughter made straight A's all year. I am so happy.
That is wonderful!  She must be so proud of herself and I know you are proud of her.  Its great that she likes learning so much.
Yes I agree. I let her choose our vacation this summer. She cried because she was so happy.
Awww_comma_ what a great idea!  That's so cute! Where are you guys going?
I could never send my parents to a nursing home. I look after them now.
You are such a good person to do that!
Thank you! They say they feel like they are the kids and it makes them feel young again.
It's crazy how the tables turn!
I think I will never walk into the local grocery store again.
Why do you say that
It was raining today_comma_ and when I walked into the store I slipped and fell right on my face.
Oh no_comma_ were you okay
I can't show my face in the bank ever again!
Oh my goodness_comma_ what happened? Did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? Those bank employees need to mind their own business_comma_ am I right!?
How did you guess? You are exactly right. Now they are talking about alerting the police!
That is absolutely unacceptable. Snitches get stitches_comma_ that's what I say. Tell me where they're at and I'll roll up on 'em and tell 'em what for. Just say the word. I've got your back.
I need someone to stay with my elderly mother for a few hours in my home.
have you asked your friends for family?
No one is available. She asked someone that I don't know and they are coming. I am a little uneasy.
i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them
I guess I just have to hope for the best and hope I don't get robbed or worse.
My husband just told me the best news ever!
Oh yeah? And what news might that be?
My husband just signed with the NFL. I never knew he was that good!
Nice! Did he sign up to be a waterboy?
So_comma_ I just found our my husband is cheating on me.
Oh my goodness_comma_ that's terrible!
I am soo mad. I can't believe he did this after being married for 15 years.
What do you plan on doing?
I don't think I will go outside in the dark ever again.
uh oh. did something happen?
Yes_comma_ I was robbed at gun point while walking home from work.
That must be traumatizing. Most people wouldn't want to go out alone after that. It's understandable.
I have been pacing waiting to hear back from Walmart after my interview.
Do you think you will get the job?
Not sure_comma_ but I really need this job to support my kids.
I hope you end up getting it!
I like to watch all the music and guitar covers on YouTube.  There's a lot of talented folks out there nowadays.
Oh definitely_comma_ Youtube is a great platform for these talented people
Yeah_comma_ it never ceases to amaze me the kinds of things you can see on YouTube.  Endless content to discover.
Yeah_comma_ my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens
I like to watch either acoustic guitar covers or vocal covers.  Makes me jealous I don't have the skills to do the same.
I am still waiting to hear the results from the doctor.
do you think there something wrong
They think I may have brain cancer. I can't seem to even sit still waiting for that phone call.
oh no thats terrible Im sorry to hear that
I am waiting to find out if I really won the lottery.
Me too! I bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night!
Wow. I spent $500.00 myself. I hope it pays off!
You and I both! No matter who wins_comma_ let's promise to split the pot.
I will be going on a once in a life time trip tomorrow.
Oh nice_comma_ where are you going?
I will be going on my first cruise.
Wow_comma_ I've never been on a cruise before. I think it sounds like a lot of fun
I can never thank my mom enough.
Why? What did she do?
She helped us pay off our house so it didn't go into foreclosure.
She is a special woman.
I am not sure how to address to my husband about how I feel about him getting a phone number from another girl.
I would be downright furious. Start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner. That should be a good segway into the conversation.
That is how I feel. I don't think he understands how it makes me feel inside.
Oh_comma_ he certainly will when he feels the hot_comma_ guilty tears running down his face from that strong_comma_ independent_comma_ jealous filled slap!
I am still in shock at the damage yesterdays flood caused.
Was any of your stuff damaged?
Yes_comma_ our whole house was swept out to sea.
Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill Moby Dick to make up for the damages.
I know I got this job_comma_ just waiting for the conformation.
Exciting! Are you moving to a new company?
No_comma_ this is the first job I have ever had just out of high school.
Oh fun! I'm so excited for you. Try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!
I never thought I would see something this gross ever!
Oh geez! What on earth was it!
I saw a guy pick a piece of chewed gum off the sidewalk and put it in his mouth.
That is FRIGGIN revolting!!! I would have lost my lunch right then and there!
