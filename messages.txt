Alone. Per the usual I suppose.
You're not "alone" in this. 
Mirtazapine is the shit
Care to... share? I know it has no sexual effects and increases appetite (which I need).
Not speaking from experience, but I guess the latter would be nicer.

...what?
Never cuddled.
Then go cuddle

Too much on my mind, I guess. 
I'm really hung up on this corn in a cup thing. Why a cup, I guess is my question?
Cup because it's not as messy as eating corn on a stick.

Hello, how are you feeling today?
I'm feeling well, but I have a cough.

Gallery sitting is mainly just sitting. It gets a little boring at times. I mostly just draw.

Why does that mean you need to be awake?
Because they expect me to have work completed for them by morning.

Goldsprints.. Sounds like a quest in an RPG maybe?
Noooope.  Want a hint or do you want to keep guessing?
Hint, please.  
In a goldsprint, you take the idea of maintaining a cadence and throw it out the window.
Cadence? That's music I believe, so I'm gonna go with singing? 
Noooope. Give up?

Where did you fly to?
"Hmm, seems to have been a trend around here lately. 

Buck the trend, ladies! Do it!"
Seriously, sometimes we are oblivious, if a girl asked me out I think that would be incredible!
"Hmm, seems to have been a trend around here lately. 

Buck the trend, ladies! Do it!"
It's soooo scary the first time though!
I don't even know who I'd ask :/
In your school?
Mmm
Oh shit Lent starts tomorrow. I don't know! Masturbate less maybe, or just watch less porn? 
how do you define less though?
Instead of every other day, maybe only 2 - 3 times a week?
Wow, i was expecting it to be a cut down in number per day!
I don't get how people love it, I hate the rain! Sun&gt;rain for me.
Where do you live? I get about 340 days of hot sunshine a year,  and it gets pretty tiresome.
Are you in arizona, by chance? I've got the same thing :D 
*Nope, sorry.*
holy shit you responded in like 4 seconds though. I respect the gusto.
*Nope, sorry.*
Midwest? 
Are you in arizona, by chance? I've got the same thing :D 
Someone else from AZ? Hello there!
Hi! I'm in school in Snottsdale right now, where are you?
I love the rain. I want to move someplace that is gray and has a lot of rain.

Straight up water
"Always good, how much you drink a day?
"
I use the XL Yeti and refill it 4-5 times per day
Them yeti's are huge, haven't seen them cheap.
Neither have I. As long as I don't lose it, it should last me many years :)
Chocolate milk
That's my crack right there.
I'm 41 and I still get excited to order a large chocolate milk when I go out to breakfast
Coffee in the morning, but I enjoy tea in the afternoon. Water would also be a top 3 choice.
Any brand coffee your rocking this week?
Nescafe Taster's Choice House Blend, nothing special really :/, but it's still pretty good :c. 
Cream Soda
"What color is your creme soda? Ours is green.

I like A&amp;W
They're great!
I got a bottle downstairs and been waiting till i'm done with the other stuff in the fridge.
I'm doing the same thing with a bottle of Oban 14 year.
Orange juice!
"What brand?

I'm digging Trop50 right now."
Simply orange all the way. They have a slightly mango flavored one that I absolutely love too. 
Never cared for mango, but i'll try it again.
Water, peppermint tea, and strawberry soy milk. Occasionally coke zero. 
Love strawberries but not a fan of soy milk.
Black coffee, water and Sprite Zero. 
Use to love black coffee.
"Use to?
"
I pretty much stopped drinking coffee.
I see. Any reason why? I keep considering it.
"First! I get all the love!  Yay!

Yes, I'm pathetic.

Hopefully you two can stay as friends at least? Hope you'll feel better soon.

Not much, that's also why I don't have much to lose these days.
Well what much is there for you? :) and can't it be said there is also not much to gain?
tangibility
What kind of proof are you talking about?
If you can't prove something to me, if there's no tangibility, why should I believe it?

Love swimming running frisbee, dislike football
Is that watching or playing? And which football?
I used to swim a lot. Then I changed states and I couldn't do it anymore because I was alone.
Tbh with you, I have actually never learnt to swim. 
I like to watch Pool, and Bowling, and Nascar, and Tennis.
Interesting mix, what kind of bowling is that?
Just regular I don't really like the trick shot bowling that much.
10 pin or crown green?
The only things we have in life is others, and time.
Well I have my thoughts.
I dont think I could even run 3 minutes.
I'm pretty sure if I ever had to run for my life, I'd be dead.

Which colorway??
Jordans. $80 shoes. I don't mind
My cousin likes them :D
Crocs. They're comfy, they float, and they're easy to slip on and off.
I love crocs! I had a hideous pair that's yellow and now I have cute turquoise ones ;)

For me it's a line from endeverafter song "never hesitate when you know you're going to act"

I tried Rakija the other day for the first time.  Was pretty good.

Why should you be called anything? It's YOUR drink of choice. And that's pefectly fine!

I'm not that old! 2007 for me.
I joined facebook when I was 17 and quit facebook when I was 18. That place is a hell hole.
A tad ironic considering the front page of Reddit, half the time.
It's mostly the self-obsession that makes facebook garbage.
I'm looking forward to that in a few months :)
Best of luck to you!

Dinosaurs are super cool.  I wish we could figure out what they actually looked like.
What color were they? They could be any color and we will never know.

How fun would that be?

Well damn, now that's some real talent there.
Shame, he could have done something with the talent, but he never developed it further
Not really. Just the same beasts as we have now, but bigger.

Staying at home like always.
Why do you always stay home?
Don't have a car and the area I live in isn't very good during the night. 
That's too bad. You don't have anyone who can drive you?
Thanks for understanding and not for the moment.
No prob, doing anything specific tonight?

Some of them, but I am not that skilled to do that often :(
How long have you been writing?
I'm just under 5'.  Very firmly in the Short camp.
Same. I'm a solid 4'11"
I'm like 4'11 1/2".  That half matters, I can round up.
Oh haha that's me too but that's just too many 1s lol. And they don't include it on my license
I'm like 4'11 1/2".  That half matters, I can round up.
174cm. Convert it to your heathen units yourself, but I dare say (and hope) that I'm average.
Depends on the gender!
I'm 176cm 5'9", which is on the taller end for a woman.
High Five fellow tall lady :D 5'11 here
Lets take over the world!
I'm an Amazon warrior anyway xD Let's do it!
Do you need an offsider? :)
I'd be glad! Your height definitely qualifies you ;)

Spear and shield would work too \^\^ Or a battle-axe
You have my axe!
I'm 181cm *(5'11 to 6'0)*. Central European woman \^\^

I refuse to believe that. Damn Americans!

Grandmother rented it as a joke.
Do you have any idea of how much it costed to rent?
No idea. She's a millionaire though, so it didn't matter much to her.

Just accept messy burgers into your life 
The only true answer
Relish them

The only true answer
Circular motions 
Like you eat the burger while rotating and have the middle part at the end? 
Yeah, never fails and keeps everything evened out 
"It's so crazy that it might work, loses some coolness points in public though
"
Cut it in half. Seriously, it works. My momma taught me that one :)
That actually makes sense, less time for the meat to get squeezed back and fall out
Order burger only when you drunk enough to not think about how to eat it.
How do I give orders to my burger?

That's annoying, I did it with the Reddit App link feature! Simple bugs like that are annoying.
I actually tried to "relink" it with the feature and it failed again... 
I like your creativity,  nice job .
Thank you! It's a small idea that'll go a long way

My professional opinion is that we all are filthy casuals. 
Professional?  I hardly her!
When people shorten certain words, my two least favorite are "Prof" and "cig"
Why Prof? For cig, I've never heard of it.
Saying "I could care less" instead of "I couldn't care less."
For all intensive purposes
I will rage flip something if this doesnt stop

The Witcher 3 as Geralt. Because that means endless stuffed unicorn time with Yennefer.

Fifth year of universty, slowy going insane 
"Do you take breaks regularly?

Summer break is the only break we get haha at university here in sweden

Last year of high school, gonna be starting uni next year. No idea what i want to study yet.

Great ! Then good luck with that bud ! &lt;3
Second year out of three doing a degree! Going uni in September to finish my final year!

Mentally done or literally done?"
I graduated college in 2004. Very literally done.
Floating through the middle of undergrad out of sequence.
Good luck! 
My "thing" is pinball, though I worry that to a lot of people, it's the only "thing" about me.
I've been playing Stern Pinball Arcade recently. Current local highscore.
Nice; what's your favorite table on that?
My "thing" is poetry/writing and uplifting people.
I love that you consider uplifting people your "thing". This belongs to /r/wholesomememes.
Sometimes, life hits you to where you realize there's something to be done.
Anime and music, definitely.
Listening to music or creating it?
Sure, what are your thoughts on square versus normal cut pizza?
Fuck as long as their's tomato sauce on that baby, I'mma eat dat boiii.

You are a mod, thanks for being a mod!
Wait I am? GASP! BEHOLD ME IN ALL MY MODLY GLORY!

Do I get superpowers? 
Of course you get superpowers, you should know that by now :)
Excuse me while I use them to ~~take over the world~~ help the innocent! 
That's right, and stop all supervillains as well!!
Sure why not. Everybody loves a little wholesome moment
What happened to you that made you feel like you need uplifting? 
Nothing really, I guess you should focus on other people, I'm doing okay
Not turning off Ariana Grande, Katy Perry or Miley Cyrus songs in the car 
Very rude of you to exclude Taylor Swift of the list. 
that's not a guilty pleasure, that's just a given
Pizza and hip hop
Hip hop shouldn't be a guilty pleasure! Do you make music or just listen? 
I can't really think of anyone right now :/
Wow not even in Porkington???
yup
I read manga a lot or watch anime.
Not really into anime much but I gotta say, I love Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
I live in a 4-plex built in 1910.

My boss isn't even in town today. He's on vacation.
Well someone didn't "just" mail the boss a glitter bomb if it just arrived
Well, technically you can do overnight shipping...so its possible.
Does creamed mean fired for opening his mail?
That's actually pretty normal in an office.

Best is when you have a popular post and wake up to 10+
I sent a PM to someone here but he/she didn't reply. I hope my message helped him/her somehow. 🙁

Moana wasn't very good.
Did you prefer Frozen?
Peaches are awful in every which way.
What?! What about apricots?
Almost equally as awful.
Interesting. Are there any other fruits you can't stand?
Actually, the only fruits I like are bananas, grapes and apples. I'm more of a vegetable guy.
How can you not like raspberries or watermelon or gooseberries or currant?
"Good question. 

Same way some don't like birthday cake?"
Ranch is absolutely disgusting. 
Ranch dressing or seasoning or all of the above?
Anything that says ranch in the name I will not touch lol

What's your favorite?
It's pretty decent, but honestly it's probably my least favorite fast food fish sandwich.
There's something about putting cheese on fish that doesn't sit right with me.
Are you feeling better now? You have my sympathies.
I'm fine now. I don't think it was the sandwich that caused my pains.

You should go talk to her if your single fam 
"If it was that easy lol.

It quite literally is
"Let me rephrase that.  
If only i wouldn't be scared of being rejected or humiliated*"
"Let me rephrase that.  
If only i wouldn't be scared of being rejected or humiliated*"
Why would you be rejected if she clearly found you handsome?
Did you fuck though?? 
"No.  
* something pretentious i wanted to write here * "
You think you would have got her number if you asked her outright?
Facebook is good enough, right?
its a start but in the spur of that moment though aint it worth it going balls deep
My bf hates to be called handsome. But he's handsome though he just hates the word lol
"Why would anyone hate to be called handsome though?  
"
I don't know he hates the word. maybe I should call him "handsome" in other language lol
"Just tell him "Ti Kra-si-voi"  
My shitty Russian for "You're Handsome""
"Hahaha 
I think he would love this one
I'll text him right away "
My interests at the moment are Aviation, video games, Chemistry and History.
Any history specifically?
Well, I'm particulary interested at the moment in Central Asian history regarding the Silk Road.
Tea, anime and food. Also recently got into rubik's cubes and succulents.
That's cool. Eating or preparing food or both?
History, PE, physics, literature.
Literature is just a fancy word for reading 😂
Most of my lit class was writing really
Current favourites are auditing and tax. 
Odd but whatever floats your boat 
Well I'm an accounting student, so I find accounting interesting. It's not odd. 
I'm not great at numbers so maybe that's why I find it weird 
Surprisingly it doesn't involve a lot of complex math!
I can say "I love you, go faster all hail the füher and hail Germany"

It sure is! Love the little critter. 
It looks like a fuzzy pear with feet and a beak.
What constitutes exotic? I like penguins, but dunno how exotic they are. 
Lol, pretty much any creature that isn't native to your country and/or continent. 
Well I don't live in Antarctica, so that'll work!
Is a Quokka exotic? I mean for an American it is but in the long run?
As long as it isn't native to your country, then it's exotic. Even invasive species count. 
Then a Quokka, they are so cute!

Hey there, friendly internet dweller. Fancy seeing you dwelling in here as well
Greetings fellow dweller.
why don't you tell me something about yourself? let's have a conversation 
Until the poor kid wrote about how he got deported, and then nobody was nice at all.
everyone is friendly until they aren't, or until they disagree with you. Shrug*
They were hateful to this kid. It wasn't a matter of simply disagreeing. 
Hey you! You'll enjoy this subreddit! What was your favourite moment of the day? 
I ate chocolate.
Chocolate solves all problems. 
This and r/crochet are my faves right now. Just good folk talkin' about stuff. 
/r/knitting as well. Such a great subreddit. 
They have nice threads there :p

Probably having a small hurricane party this weekend. 
:( Hope it doesn't take too hard of a tolm
Hey! 25M on a 24 hour shift. Let's do this together.
I'm down. I'm afraid if I don't talk to someone, even online, I won't make it. 
I have never touched ffvii to tell you the truth. 
Did you touch any of the others?
I've played ff13 for a bit but I couldn't go through it. Wasn't a fan of the characters.
I reeeaallly need to take a shit but I'm just too damn lazy 
Lmao! You might want to take care of that. 
Yes, yes. I might just do that before I leave campus 
I have a job interview tomorrow! 
Yay!! I recently got a new job. I hope you rock the interview!
Thanks!
Let me know how it goes:)
Didn't get it. They were looking for someone available for a different schedule. 
I hope you rewarded her for caring about your well-being!
Gave her a can of fancy feast :)
I kinda want a cat. 
Go get one.

Senior year of High School or College?

Are you planning on going to college or getting a job outta high school?
":( 

Going alright.  Boring, but alright"
That’s good! I mean, okay. Better than bad right?
Yeah for sure.  How's your day going?
It’s going okay. It could always be worse. But that fact isn’t always comforting.
Yeah.  I mean being happy just because your not miserable seems kinda silly when said out loud.
Hows it going? Ill be your friend! Do you play any online games?
No but I totally could 
The closest friend you can ever have is your penis.
What?
You seem like such a lovely person reading all of this :)
No YOU’RE lovely :)
so far i'm good, just not looking forward to school. and you?
I don't think anyone looks forward to school :) I've been better
Eh, feeling a bit down, but better today than I have been other days
That is good. One day at a time. Hope tomorrow is slightly better again.
I showed someone my music taste other than Tristam because they requested it. Now I regret it
Why would you regret it :( what is your taste?
Living the dream, buddy. How are you?
Am doing better, having a good night with some pasta and movies. What's the dream?
The real dream is finding a new job that isn't so empty and sad.
I can only hope for hope at this point.
Hold onto more than hope and know that your life is valuable and you are unique and important.
I am good but thank you. Need good folks like you around :)
I'm happy that you're happy :)
Thanks! How are you doing? Did you eat today? Drinking enough water?
Well if someone could gift me dark souls prepare to die edition on steam i'd be happy :0

What is something you wish you got complimented more on?
"My ex made me one
I became hooked 
We broke up
I made a new one 

Here we are. "
Sorry to hear about that. At least your love of Reddit remained 
Lol not a bad thing but Reddit was definitely one of the good things I got from him.
Mainly because I wanted to participate in some of the sub related to what I like.
Makes sense tbh
How long has he known her?
A year, he started dating her a month ago. 
"Wow. Kinda a dick move on his part.

Obviously most of the blame goes to succubus girl wonder."
I agree. Maybe our paths will cross again in the future. 
Unless he realises that he was a douchey douche, then I’d say forget him.
Try to be there for him when she inevitably fucks him over, too.
You're right, I can see that happening. Which will suck, because he isn't a bad dude. 
Keep your chin up, mate. It's not your fault.
Sorry to hear that chap.
Thanks, I appreciate it. 
Probably how ive managed to learn to face some of my fears.
What were some fears?
being afraid to ask girls out, being less socially anxious/paranoid. Fear of trying new things.
Are you a dog person or a cat person
Hard question, I love them both. But if I have to choose one I´ll have to go with dogs.
What are your go to pizza toppings?
I´m a sucker for Pizza Funghi. What have you been watching lately?
What is your dream car?
A G-Wagon. What small thing can make your day?
I'm too lazy to go to the gym today. What do I do to overcome this?
I’m lazy myself. But take a shower and step outside the door maybe? 
Favourite biscuit variant? Mine are shortbread.
Bastogne,  you know it?
"GOOD LUCK! ITS NOT YOUR LAST SHOT, LOVE. 

AHHHHH!"
I know, but I always get my hopes up for no reason. 
Never forget it's not your last shot! Be persistent! Have confidence!
Thanks, I'm about to leave now for the interview. Dressed for success. 
Grab’em by the pussy!!
Haha
Best luck man!! Forgot to say it!!
Good luck. Hope you crack it. 
Thanks, this means so much. Good vibes are key.
Goodluck man!
Thanks, I already had the interview. It was yesterday. 
I don't think that I have ever seen myself in a dream. I wonder what that means 
same, i’ve never seen myself in my dream before
I see myself with bangs and dark hair...sometimes I don't have a body. 
And what's your hair like in real life?
Long and brown, no bangs
I wonder, why would your mind give you different hair in your dreams... Maybe it suits you more?
It 11am over here, I'm about to head over to campus.
Where in the world are you?
Heartbroken. 
You okay?

Are you trying to sell me chocolate or what?
Did someone say *chocolates*
I remember when they first invented chocolate. *Sweet, sweet chocolate* 
I always hated it!
WHATRE THEY SELLING??
THEYRE SELLING CHUAHKLATES
**WHATRE THEY SELLING??!!!"**
I thought you would never say it! It's been 24 years!
I was busy, god
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS TOO BUSY TO LOVE ME
IM DONE. IM LEAVING. KEEP THE CAT
"Prove it!!!
"
"*lifts up sleeve*

I got a tattoo of your face"
"Get to know me, I bet you'll fall out of love for some reason :)
"
Why would I get to know someone I already know everything about? 
Because love isn't true love when it's once sided.
"It's not like I like YOU, or a-anything
...
B-baka!"
You don’t have to like me to love me baka 
why
You’re an amazing person 
Aww! This is like him to me....
Love never leaves, it only gets recycled 
At least buy me dinner first
"*holding plate in hand*

Where should I put it"
I don't know you anymore. 
It was a **mistake**
Was it **really**?
HE KISSED ME WHEN I WASNT EVEN LOOKING
How were you not looking out the front of your face?
He was wearing all camouflage 
Camouflage doesn't make people invisible when they're that close. 
Fine I kissed him, but only because I wasn’t getting any from you :(
Aww thanks, lol. Love you too.
I especially love you for delivering my mail
It's not you, it's me.
It’s not you, it’s her
Hit me with what you got!
I think you are the random trivia person who delights in having knowledge to spout. 
Hey
You want to do more than you can chew. Often starting projects but not finishing them. 
Do mine thx
You like to takes things slowly. You enjoy your me time and rather not have to socialize a lot. 
I don't know how you got that from my username but damn you got me
Dang, I was late.
-leaves pie for you- 
Pumpkin?
It's a shame this is closed. I'd be low hanging fruit.
-leaves apple pie for you- 
It's a shame this is closed. I'd be low hanging fruit.
Hey, friend. I bet the same assumptions can be made about you and I. 
This will be fun
You are someone that tries to do right by people. You like to help others. 
And well you should!!
You try to keep things simple because if not you get overwhelmed. 
A swing and a miss. Frugalista, I'm *frugal*.
Hi
You have many secrets and often it makes you lonely. So you are starting to reach out more. 
Seems interesting enough, why not 
You are very imaginative and sometimes get lost in your own thoughts a lot. 
I'm very interested in what you have to say
You are the kind of person who tries to be an ally to others. Maybe even volunteering. 
Abba.

this post was what i needed to get through the morning, thanks OP!
You're welcome! Hope you turn your morning from an obstacle into an adventure :)
Could I choose the first one but still eat and keep my perfect body?
Good question..haha, I just modified the question to account for this.
Yeah, in that case the answer is I'd take neither. 
That's not how it works lol
Well, I like sleeping and I like eating so being forced to give one of them up kind of sucks. 
I want to change and become a better version of myself that I can fine with. 
Do you know how you would like to be?  
No :(
It is hard to make general changes.   Can you think of something concrete to change?
It's hard when life doesn't go as planned. 
Does life ever go as planned?
In the middle of writing my personal statement OMG it's really hard

Quite possible. But, why did she have the treadmill running? 
Because she was "juuuuust about to start" the whole time.

Exercise ?
She’s probably going there just to say that she goes to a gym.
Unfortunately that's a very common practice to happen nowadays

Yeah it takes me forever to type. 
...but you sound like a CEO, so there's that.
I like the iphone keyboard pop noises a bit. 
yess! The sound is just so satisfying. Especially if you can type really fast 
My bf just got a mechanical keyboard and I love the clicky noise
ohhh aren't those the keyboards that have the really thick keys like an old iMac keyboard?
Yep, or like the ubiquitous IBM model M
Get a cherry bridge mechanical keyboard, Once you go clack you don't go back.
I want one so bad! But I have a laptop and no place for a desktop :(
Get a lap desk, might give you enough room for a keyboard.
Yeah... but even then I don't have a place for an actual computer. My room is heckin' small 
Then keep the dream until one day you can have a desk.
42
I've heard that before but what does that actually mean?
It is the answer, but what is the question?
So the meaning of life is 21x2.
That can't be the right one. 
Is it 43-1?
Can't be it either.
If the answer is 42, then what is the question - you seem to know...
I don't know it. But if someone finds out, we'll know
I've heard that before but what does that actually mean?

I've never seen that show. 
There are lots of pawns in that show that you could relate to.
Ok
I don't know but it's nothing you said. 
So you don't want a family? Why?
"1. Let life play out however it does

2. Find a good death"
What do you consider a good death?
I wish I was loved. 
Whys that?
Because it would make me feel happy and satisfied. 
I see, What other things make you happy and satisfied?
Food and maybe working out 
"Maybe you can meet some one doing those things?

"
You could meet someone while doing food?
Cooking food maybe, I don't know.
Like a cooking class? That's a good idea. Take a cooking class, /u/-DemonicBunny.
I'm poor. &gt;:O

Boiled egg, poached egg or scrambled egg
Sounds delicious! I'm just headed out for a late lunch now at a Korean restaurant.

Spicy pork hotpot! 
It has spicy and hot in the name.... Don't do it!!
You're not a fan of spicy food? I love it!
I can do some spicy food but Asian food is not one, Asian food spicy is butt on fire
I love all kinds of Asian food! Luckily I've never experienced that problem. 
Lol then good luck, what's for dinner tomorrow
Not sure yet! Haven't even decided what tonight's dinner will be! Maybe pasta. 
What kind of pasta??? 
I'm thinking cheese tortellini!
Never tried it??? What's it taste like
Just pasta with cheese inside!
Like Cheese Manicotti or ravioli
Yeah basically the same as ravioli!
The fact that I have the day off tomorrow, no meetings, lectures or seminars. woot!
Nice! What're you going to do? 
Probably same thing I always do, a bit of dissertation work and a whole lot of nothing

Both appeared in my inbox
Did one appear as a reply (ie someone commented) vs a message or notification?
Hahaha you're right. Only /u/ appeared in mention. Alright, TIL!
That's exactly what I already did
Test 2: /u/Realblazestorm
So? Which one is it?
I instantly assume the OP was gay, and I feel kinda sexist for it now
I thought op was a woman and now I feel bad for assuming gender. 
Congratulations! I'm marrying my best friend in 3 weeks! Love is a wonderful thing isn't it?

We met in highschool right at the end of it we've been completed inseparable ever since. 
That's so exciting!!! Congrats!!! How long have you been with your fiance?
I think 4  years is coming up soon!
My condolences ;)
I don't really think that that's the best word for it lol
It was a joke because I'm sad, lonely and don't think anyone deserves happiness. 
Hope things turn around then.
You seem nice :)
So do you, mate. :D
Love this sub.

With a lot of cool whip!
I’ve never had cool whip! Is it like whipped cream?
Warm, with vanilla ice cream! Other than that I don't really have a technique. 
"You have ice cream with a pie?

You monster."
It seems to be the norm where I am. 
Pies should be doused with gravy and nothing more!
I'm talking about fruit pies though. 
Home Depot is alright, but small hardware stores smell even better.  All the scents at once.
Got any nice local hardware stores near you?
I love the smell of un-subtle advertising. Sooo good. 
Why would a company as big as THD advertise their chain to small-ish subreddit? X
When I was a kid I used to love the smell of an ace hardware 😂😂
Ace is the place with the helpful hardware folks.

I go base of the pyramid up 
I haven't had those in like a decade. How would you describe the taste? 
Pretty much how they've always been, like highly concentrated sugar. So if you like sugar...
-_-
We can agree to disagree on this.
We can agree to ship all our useless candy corn to OP.
I honestly don’t like candy corn but i bought it anyway. I really enjoy the texture 
Yeah, it's hard to describe but I like it too. Almost a sort of waxy feel.
Yeah, it's hard to describe but I like it too. Almost a sort of waxy feel.
Candy Corn is the Devil's earwax!
Try it with peanuts.
Don't really like peanuts, unfortunately.
Pretzels maybe?  It's the whole sweet salty thing.
What's candy corn. I'm Scottish so I've never had one
They're basically candy forms of concentrated sugar. They seem to only be popular in the US.
What flavour are they?
Sweet. A sort of slight honey/caramel, but really just sweet like sugar.

Hi!

Just working on some math homework  while on reddit haha. What can I call you?
Rainbow 6? PC??
Yup. I just started though, so I'm crap at the game
Perfect. What's your Steam? I can play  and Thursday!
Looks like you made alot of friends 👍
I made more than I can count. Haha it's been a great night.
I might steal your idea for a different night :p 
My idea is already a stolen idea haha. It still made for a great day though lol.
Lol good then you can't be upset with me :p 
Damn. I shouldn't have told you that.

I like to add a little honey, too.

You must not live in the south poor thing. 
I hate to break it to ya, but I definitely live smack dab in the middle of the south :)
Peanut butter and pickle sandwhiches are quite good too
Came here to suggest this!  Ive eaten Pb&amp;P sandwiches since i was a kid.
I prefer creamy, but my wife likes crunchy. I'm fine with either.
I thought I was fine with either, until today. I don't understand how this happened to me.
Let us take a moment to mourn the passing of preference for crunchy peanut butter.
Should we all have peanut butter stuck to the roof of our mouths for this?
Absolutely. And at the wake we'll have various peanut butter snacks.
Oh, yeah! Reese's. Peanut butter cookies. Buckeyes.
Crunchy. I like to know where my various butters come from.
In the US, half the peanuts come from my home state of Georgia.
Where's the "just regular peanuts" option?
Regular peanuts roll out of the sandwich.
well your first mistake was peanuts and sandwiches
There are no mistakes when peanuts are involved.
Crunchy. So crunchy is like I'm putting sucky peanuts on my honey toast
sucky peanuts? does not compute
Whoops. Fixed it!
Enjoy the heat while it lasts 
The heat is miserable and muggy. I never ever miss it when it's gone. Which is hardly ever.

Meghan Merkel. So cute. 
I know right! She’s beautiful. Her and harry look so happy together, im happy for them.

Aw, this makes me sad. I hope you're okay, friend.
Skyrim, the fact that you can do so much with the game is what makes it cool.
Mods add practically infinite replay value too! I love messing with the physics
I do love a good mod, which ways do you like to mess with the physics?
Game of Thrones
The Telltale series? I screwed that up badly the first time D:
The tv show. I was just making a pun and having fun. :)
This is so plausible it's actually kinda sad.

What if we were from Mars and came to Earth
Wouldn’t we need a form of transportation?

Except you can literally see Earth from Mars. Just saying.

Everything gets better in time I promise

I always liked Onix 
How could you not? :) Giant-ass rock-snake FTW
Probably my second favourite behind Infernape 
I have good memories of Infernape in Platinum. 
Has to be Leafeon. I just love the razor-sharp leaves aesthetic!
Look, I'm a member of the Eevee fan-club too, but we're only doing original 151
Is Leafeon not one of the original 151? The more you know.

Not if it's Monopoly. In Monopoly, everyone who's rich is cheating. The game is so realistic.
The switch version of Monopoly is super fun, and you can't cheat :)

Once posted in a thread over a year old. OP still responded

Yes, all the time...hope I'm not too late for this one!
Here's an orange envelope for you friend! Hope your day's going well. 
Thanks, friend! So far, so good (despite the usual anxiety). Hope your day is going well too!
Yeah not bad! just another hour and a half of my work day to go! Huzzah!

Well I had a good comment for this, but now it’s 9 years old and my comment feels useless.
I see how you deliberately said "years" instead of "hours" hopping someone would correct you. 
Solution: be on Reddit more during the day. We are one...
Well there's time zone so...
It’s a joke 
Does this comment matter?
No. 
Every single time I post a comment.(this comment,for example. Fuck.)
This
Never fails,does it?
It's like nobody even reads your comments
Pretty much. Not sure if I'm boring,or just late to every post,lol
You're boring
Hey! You wanna talk about what's going on?
Pressure from studies, some of my peers being jerks, and a bit of anxiety, really. Also, hello!
Hi, I'm Allie!!  Why are you feeling down?
Studies, Allie. Studies got me a bit down.
Standard end of semester stress?  what are you studying?
Hey /u/MetalJaw, how has your day been? :) 
Not so good, but it has gotten better.
What's going on that's made your day not so good? 
Jerk peers, Matt. I already got enough on my plate, but they really get on my nerves.
What have your peers been doing that's so jerky?
Speaking behind my back, patronising me, etc. It's quite hard to ignore.
Saved a kid from a heroin overdose, it's always fun.

How are you finding them?
He's the one doing it! /s
I did some research on immigration process
Are you looking to immigrate somewhere? If so, where to? 
Doki Doki Literature Club.  It's free, it's not what it seems, play it. 
I have heard of this game. I know it is getting quite popular and it does seem interesting.
An old classic I never finished as a kid: Secret of Mana.
Never played that game. But it looks fun.

What is an OG post?
Good for you mate. Onwards and upwards!
Ya not sure man I’m not going to overthink but it was enjoyable.
If time flew by that means it wasn't awkward and conversation was flowing 
Felt like that indeed.
Congratulations! I hope you both had a great time.
I enjoyed it and like I said it flew by. I'm hoping I can get a second date.
How come you're not sure / hoping?
Congrats! It's gotta start somewhere
Interesting username.... lol

Cooking anything complex. It is hard to know when something is done.
What is it that you love about cooking complex meals?
The act of creating it and the possibility that it might work.
Drawing haha
When you draw haha, how does it look?
A bagel and little donuts. :d
That's nice. Comfort food I guess? To be honest, :) I never had bagel before. 
It's really good it has seeds on top of it. I get it from Dunkin Donuts
I'm very into oranges and clementines lately.  
"Interesting. :) They are both very healthy!

"
I could go for some English muffin pizzas.
Oh okay! Now? :)
I could really go for something with a ton of mozzarella in it right now. 
With pizza or bread? 
Yeah, or with pasta or something. 
I'm with you.  I love it. 
Yep. It's exciting but yet so calm.
I'm with you.  I love it. 
Do it enough and it gets boring. 
That’s everything though 
Not anal
Yeah, I’m on board with this. 
I’ll check this out sometime...
Just plan your trip well first. Don't just wing it. 
That’s the ticket!  Thanks for the tip.
You are getting punny! Calling you out, plane and simple
My love of puns is really taking off!
My love of puns is actually a bit more grounded.
Sounds like you’ve got some baggage there.  More to that story, I guess?
My brain is being hijacked by all these shitty plane puns.
At least you’re not board...
No, you can’t reuse “board”. That doesn’t fly here.
At least you’re not board...
I work at an airport, I agree. Its a nice time to take a break.
I've always thought of airports as like a 24/7 mall. Truth?
For PDX sortof, stores close from 11pm to 4am.
PDX! Best airport ever, love it.
5 years in a row!
I havent been to an airport in my entire life :(

What did the guy on the phone say to change your mind? 
It was just his tone of voice... he didn’t force his words 
How many people have you replied to now? 
I had 240 inbox =\ down to 84 now

"How come

Because it doesn't I don't give a fuck what anyone else says

My favorite show was added to Amazon Prime after being off streaming sites for about 2 years.

Working on a documentary for class and IMovie is actually pretty nice. 
Oooo documentary! Congrats! 
#3 is your lie?
3 is very true.
"1. I've never been to Florida
2. I've never had a cavity
3. I've never seen Forrest Gump"
The lie is that you've never seen Forrest Gump.
"1. I've never been to Florida
2. I've never had a cavity
3. I've never seen Forrest Gump"
OOhhh,.. tough ones. I'll say, #1 is the lie
Nope.
#2.
3 is very true.
"1 - True  
2 - Lie  
3 - True"
Correct! What are yours?
"1 - I can speak french  
2 - I've never watch *Star Wars*  
3 - I've broken my arm once"
I'll say, #1. But if is, I want to know why you don't watch Star Wars. It's great
"1 - I can speak french  
2 - I've never watch *Star Wars*  
3 - I've broken my arm once"
The lie is that you've broken your arm once.
"1. I hate Rebel scum.

2. I hate Star Wars.

3. Shortbread is the greatest food in the world."
Your username suggests that #1 might be true, and that #2 might be false.
Correct! I must spread the message of the Empire somehow.
"1) I own a dog
2) I've had a vacation in South America
3) I've been summoned for jury duty"
3 is the lie!
"This is MY swamp! MY swamp.

Aw, the poor thing! That's adorable. :) I bet that cashier got a good giggle out of that. 
She was laughing at me a bunch. I think. 
But was the hot chocolate good?!
yep, I'll just take a wrong order instead of correcting the worker to avoid confrontation
*I mean, I guess onions rings are fine*
Who sais hot chocolate isn't for adults?
It was an 8 oz luke warm hot chocolate. If it was bigger and HOT, I’d agree with you.
*facetables* Humans...
I thought it was pronounced "Headdesk"
It goes by "facetable" in my locale, this is the first I've heard of "headdesk".

Awesome. How do you like it? 
It hasn’t arrived yet, I order it off eBay.
Ah, well I hope it makes all your dreams come true! 
It hasn’t arrived yet, I order it off eBay.

Can’t you buy a new one for like $300?

Does it include some games?"
Yes, the new Mario and the new Mario and Rabbids 
Enjoy! :D

No offense, but I remind this story being told exactly the same way a few days ago?
Was it? I posted this story last night but it got deleted so I'm posting again.
Ah okay, than that's where I remembered it. The few days ago seemed to be just hours then.
Thought this only happened to me. :D

I’m afraid it will never be seen (like this comment)

I know right. Woke up to all that good karma. Today is going to be a good day :)
Sure. I've heard they have good chocolate. 
Expensive though.
Of yourse! I'm sure it would be a day you'd never forget.
True - but Switzerland is expensive.
I think Drunk-you should go since they bought the ticket
that is a very good point - beers before I go
It would be a waste if you didn't. A day in Geneva is a day well spent.
You been before?
If you can afford it, go.  If you can’t afford it, go anyway.  It’s Sweden!
Is... is that a pun?

Gold prospecting. Gets you outdoors and possibly with a side income 
Unfortunately there's not too much gold in the Midwest XD

Manboobs are annoying. I blame mine on all the plastic and chemicals in our food and water.
Might be better blaming it on lack of exercise, and poor serving size choices.

"I apologize that I suck at remembering names.  What's yours again?"
Hahaha...that's my case..it really sucks...what's urs....
ChickenXing omg you really bad at this i guess huh?  
Hahaha...that's my case..it really sucks...what's urs....
Hahaha...that's my case..it really sucks...what's urs....
Then you have to follow up with.... "oh I knew that, I ment your last name." 
"I apologize that I suck at remembering names.  What's yours again?"
How do you ask that question for the 5th time?
How do you ask that question for the 5th time?

Its looks too odd really...
""Sorry what's your name?"

when they look at you confused say:

"I mean your last name""
That's been in the internet for years now. Would be obvious if actually used imo.
Ask him how to spell it
Good idea..
Trawl through the friends list of a mutual friend on Facebook? 
What if you don't get time
Then how much are you bothered?
What if you just come across someone..
I just ask, 'what the fuck is your name again?'  I have to do it a lot at work. 
Yeah but it feels bad..
So? If you want to know, it's what you gotta do. 
No other way though but is it necessary to use his or her name during conversation...
I take a risk and say "how do you spell your name (again)?"
Risky at times like in my case
I mean... mat or matt is a fair question :p
""So how do you spell your name?"

"Uh...T-i-m?"

"Hahaha no your last name!""
S-m-i-t-h, you tard. 
"1. Come on Eileen

2. Definitely ;)

Happy to meet a like-minded individual.  Honestly.
"Nice to meet you friend :)
I thought everybody did this! It keeps me going."
Woah?!! It’s just that easy? Fuck off.

This is probably a movie reference but it’s lost on me lol
...Four years and no ring?   That sounds like the opposite of supportive and caring to me.
Funny, I didn’t realize there was an expiration date for marriage.

California. Pleasure. I'm a model.
Just the beach I guess. Not that fun but definitely beautiful
As someone who did not grow up around a beach, I think that'd be fun! 
I'm headed to see Jumani!
Enjoy!! Let me know how it is! 
Change is always scary. Do you already have another job?
Nope. But I have saved up some money and hopefully it can cover my expenses until my next job.

It’s ok! No worries man at least you commented!

Wanted to at first but I couldn't find a box big enough, unfortunantely. :(
Smooth. How could she not say yes?!
Goodluck! I had the same issue, 4 years strong at 16. You will be fine if shes as you say.
Thank you! I really do hope I'm going to be fine haha.
So friendzoned then?
I hope not. I will try to not get into it in the first place.
keep us updated honestly im trying to do the same thing
Wish it happened with me!
Maybe one day something similar will happen to you. :)
OP days he will go all in and ask ole girl out. I want an update once he does!
Will do, no worries haha.
Good! I hope it goes well for you, although as jaded as I am I fully expect it to go poorly
Hope for the best, expect the worst.
Honestly the chewing gum gift is adorable and hilarious
You think? I didn't think that it was that good. Apparently she enjoyed it though.
I take it that she doesn't like to be stirred? :-)
No, but she really likes to Bond with her human.
I imagine that's pretty Q-ute.
My furry companions like wearing costumes; what happened to your cat when it was a kitten?
What kind of costumes? And what do ou mean about what happened to her?

My cat used to try and bite me as soon as I went near his belly lol
Happy cake day! 
Someone else said that, what they is cake day?
It's the "Birthday" of when you joined Reddit. See the little cake by your username?
Oh wow! I knew it was soon but not today! Happy birthday to me!
"I have a date! I am excited.

And a little nervous."
Best of luck my dude! It's okay to be nervous!
Maybe you remind him of someone.
But is all this necessary because of that?
Nope. He sounds like a creep. You could say hi to him and tell us how he reacted.
I am afraid that he would think that I am interested in him and it would get only worse
Just tell him, “What the fuck do you want? You’re bothering me and in my space.”
I am too polite for something like this, but even I have my limits
Say it in a joking like casual angry tone. Not a true angry tone. 
The way he knocked on my window, damn...
Well that sounds scary as shit
OP, please update us when you can. Honestly worried :(
Everything is fine, thank you for your concerns.
I’m glad it is! What you described is us female commuters’ recurring nightmare
r/LetsNotMeet
Should I post?
Fwiw, stay safe OP. This story kind of freaked me out :(
That knock on the window freaked me too
Yea.. Happy you're out of there atm at least!
The guy is s fucking pscho
 I am really glad that he doesn’t look like Arnold in his prime
Might be a good idea to confront him. He’ll probably find another train

Shoot!

Bigfoot is flat.
Given that bigfoot leaves footprints, which are 3-d - you are wrong.
Those footprints were planted by the National Trust.
The National Trust wants to encourage visitors - Bigfoot is scary, this must be a conspiracy.
Bigfoot is scary, flat and scary, like a demented ironing board.
That is purely conjecture and abstrationism.
Bigfoot is flat.
He’s definitely flat footed based on his walking style.

Is washing a dangerous thing for your hoodie? Or does it hold up well?
The real question is does she reply you when you text her when you aren't feeling sleepy?
I don't text her if I can't sleep. She has stayed up late to talk when I've needed it though 
You should! I'm sure she would prefer it if you did :)
 Does she have depression? Are you worried she will hurt herself? Otherwise, you are too nice. 
She's just emotional and needs to vent a lot. I like being there for her

Thankfully guns are pretty scarce down in Melbourne and Victoria so I doubt it'll go that way.

I dunno if this is a pro or a con, but being a Muslim, I have no booze money
It's an expression. Point is: it's affordable. 
I get the expression, believe me, where I'm from; it's not

Nope, then again I have never come across someone with my same name.

Both very good choices. Have you ever been to a pine grove?
A pine grove? As in a clearing in a pine forest, or?

NICE JOB!!!
Congratulations!!!!
Thank you! All these nice messages have me feeling fuzzy and warm inside :)
Good for you OP, but I don't think I'm going to meet another redditor. It's just awkward IRL.

Wouldn't the milk splash all over the place if you put cereal on top? Damnit now I'm hungry....
Exactly! Humans are strange creatures 
True true! I hear some even put the milk in before the bowl!    
Yeah and they pour that milk into a cup..
sadly, too many of my days are like that.
Hang in there
oh, I'm hung in there. just not good at occupying myself as productively as I'd like to.
The best water is the water in the glass next to my bed when I wake up hungover.

Nice! Any specific games you really enjoy?

Oh yeah, Skyrim is an amazing game!
Fuck this makes me sad. Why do I have to appreciate what I have only after I’ve lost it. 
Your coffee machine broke too? 
My "partner" has spoken to me 8 times in 2018.
:( need someone to talk to? Happy to listen. 
So being willing to drink a crappy cup of coffee so you can enjoy a good one is "sweet"?
Quietly prioritising your partner’s comfort over your own? Yes. Very sweet. 
He buys me carnivorous plants, bc he knows I love torturing bugs.

Silent Hill is my favourite series. The 2nd is the best of all of them :) Great lore
Ignoring skyrim as its too obvious, I'd go with darksiders 2 cos i played through it so much
I played that game too! Really fun movement and combat. It's like low difficulty Dark Souls :D
Basically! Great for me

No way... I refuse to believe anyone over the age of 10 can make this mistake.
Yeah, noah fence doesn't really hold water.
His ark was much better
'Segway' bugs me. It's 'segue.' 
Maybe they are talking about those scooter things.
I fucking cringe when someone says “he did a complete 360”
So "half 360" it should be then?
Also "er on the cautious side" not "air" 
Err not er :)
That's great! It feels good to fully understand yourself :) Do you lean one way or another?

I like the way drunk you thinks.
If he never stops drinking he can never get hungover 
So in a way drunk me is looking after sober me?

There are some comments that makes fun of people who died.
True. Why are subs like r/watchpeopledie or r/wincest or even stuff like r/misogyny allowed?
/r/wincest is innocent; it is a isolated fetish with fake videos and photos.
Fake? It looks real TBH

I wrote a book. I'm afraid to let people see it.
Could you let one person see? Someone you trust? Sometimes it gets easier from there. 
I mean, that's a lot of trust.

Physics, maths, and psychology. Each of them are a pain in the ass 
I hated Math in college!!! I’m not a math guy. I’m surprised I passed. 
Hello fellow European, if you still want to chat I would be happy to kept you company.
Hi buddy! How’s you’re day going? 
Not bad, I know better but also worst. How about you, is your day getting better? 
Hi! I hope your day gets better. I'm here if you want to talk! Best wishes.
Hey! Thank you for the comment! It really means a lot. This chat has defo helped. :)
I actually stopped eating.
"What's your way to survive then?

"Yes pineapple goes well with pizza. There, I said it. 

My username checks out too. "
Agreed, my favorite pizza is a chicken, bbq sauce and pineapple. It works surprisingly well. 
I love spaghetti and any kind of pasta.  Also, pineapple does not belong anywhere near a pizza.
What about deep inside a calzone?
He-Man. 
Another great one
Congratulations. I stopped smoking on New Years and haven't felt this good in a long time!

Never have I ever been on an airplane!
I just got off an airplane and I'm getting ready to get on another one!
I hope you have a wonderful time  wherever you are going!
I'm going home and I'm going to sleep forever!
Sleeping in your own bed after traveling is such a good feeling.
Sleep is awesome in general :)
Never have I ever gotten an A on a paper I've waited to write till the last minute. 
Still in shock

Is this as common as people say? I never have
I'm not quite sure... You get to ask a question now!
Never have I ever embarrassed myself in front of a large group of people?
Never have I ever been kidnapped
I have by my friends but not seriously lol 
Kik has some decent chat rooms 
Best rooms seem to be full up for me:(

This is by far one of the more pleasant parts of Reddit.
Agreed! R/offmychest is pretty nice too, but this sub is way better 
This really is the most wholesome subreddit.

We're not in-your-face positivity, which I find crass.

that sub has a very artificial, forced feel to it. I rate this one higher for its sincerity. 
Absolutely! It's always nice to come here, just to escape some of the negativity.
The username and that comment make for an interesting pair, to say the least.
Maybe he just loses at being a loser, which in turn makes him a winner?

What did you learn?
The universe hates me, and to bring empanadas next time.
Wrong. The answer I was looking for was: "Install a garbage disposal in my bath tub"
why is food anywhere near the bathroom
Because bathing and eating is luxurious and efficient.
Why were you holding your food over your bath? Were you eating breakfast in the bathtub? 
I was indeed. Or at least planning to.
Sounds like a recipe for disaster. Always gotta expect the worst outcome. 
I had no idea that people actually brought food into the bathroom.  Ouch
I get it, I'm a weirdo. I just wanted to snack in luxury! IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK??
Too ambitious
Soup! Now, you have soup?
Pizza brownie human soup
Is there more? 
A bit, yeah. I had a depression brownie in honor of this incident.
What was the occasion for your bathtub indulgence? 
Stress and self-loathing.
We love you though
Oh. Not very well. I thought it was Saturday :(

ah social isolation is the worst. I'm pretty tired, but im good. University? 
Not too bad, but I want something to eat. 
What do you want to eat/
Sushi if I had a choice.
Not great but doing better, what's something you like to do to feel better? 
Well I listen to music that's slightly sad, I talk to people online, or vent

Greetings from Belgium, my friend,
Don't like Harry Potter despite being into a lot of geek stuff.

Speakers are miles better than head/earphones. 
People on my morning bus unfortunately agree with you.
There is no such thing as free will.
That’s teetering on politics
There is no such thing as free will.

I have a right to die.
But when you want to die, are you in the correct mindset to make a good choice?
In fact I'm probably in a better mindset than most others.
"Check your HALT.

Hungry?  Angry?  Lonely?  Tired?  Correct each and re-scan."
None of those are a problem for me.
Then your perception of the value of your life is.
That I dislike shows like Family Guy, the Simpsons, etc.
Disliking Family Guy isn't an unpopular opinion. It's pretty much the norm now.
The best pizza toppings is pineapple and jalapeno.
Best pizza I've ever had was pineapples, jalapeno and pepperoni. So good

Coffee and tea sucks and so does bacon and doughnuts
Just say everything sucks, it's not a large leap.

"Don't advertise being a woman.  
That would be a good start."
Yep. Someone else did point that out already, so. I have learned that.
Don't let anyone know your female and 25! 13 year olds will PM you dicks!
So I have been told lol. Thank you, I have learned not to do that now.
We have to stay home, it's raining all day where we are :(
Ah man, that sucks! Do you have any plans to make up for this?
Nope, ah well though. The good thing is I have tomorrow off as well.
There is no God Summer, might as well rip that band aid off and be done with it. 
Can't agree.
I can't go swimming because I'm in Alaska and it's like 70° max tomorrow.

Long and boring tv-series of all sorts. Nothing really happens for hours of screen time.

To be dead already.
Why?
Because i think life is meaningless and pointless and surviving takes too much bs.
So you are in constant agony? 
Yes
Physical agony?
Sometimes.
So it's mostly mental agony then?
Sure
Well, in that case, there is hope. There are treatments. 
For coping with existence?
Define existence. 
Merely having conciosness in this world
So you dislike what your surroundings present to your conscience? 
I dislike playing the "survival game"

What do you think would happen, if I started wearing a wedding band as a dude?
There was an episode of Seinfeld where George tried it. Negative results ensued.
So if everyone wore engagement rings, everyone would be more polite to each other! 
But then no one would get laid :(
That's... That's not how it works. 
Are you Israeli ?
No, why?

I skip breakfast because I prefer sleep. Do you feel better now? :P
Idk man. All this cheese might make me feel constipated later on today.
Idk man, I think that's better than skipping breakfast :P
You say that, until it feels like your droppings are gonna come out the other way.
Good heavens. Go eat some fibre man XD
But that involves getting up.
You don't need to put on pants to eat fibre. If anything that makes it harder.
You got me there. I'm gonna fuck myself up a banana.

How was it? 
I have an affinity towards gender neutral names like Alex, Sam, and Riley, for example.
Yes I love gender neutral names, Alex is my fav. I always wished my name was more androgynous.

Peraonally I have found about 4- 5 but more than that I feel sleepy all day.
Oh wow not much then! Honestly I wish I could get by on that much
10 hours +15 minutes after I wake up
That's a lot of sleep!! Are you dedicated to going to bed on time every night?
No, most of the time I stay up ti'll 10:50 - 11:20
Haha going to bed on time is hard
You got that right, I mostly spend my time on this subreddit actually
Oh really! Just chatting away all that valuable sleeping time haha :P
Yes! Exactly what I'm doing now! It's summer here and it's like 4AM!
Haha you're dedicated. Summer here too but only 4:40pm.

I’ll remember to mention you at the karmies. 
Don't trust people with a lot of karma. 
What’s a lot of karma to you? 
Anything over 5 or 10k.
You can trust me then. 
not for long
I feel the same. Getting 11.7k karma in one post got me flying.
hot damn. 
I know right lol. Before that I never realized how hard it was to actually get karma 
this is some labour intensive stuff my man 
A soldier!
That's an easy one too get into atleast. They are always looking for people to join up.
Not in my country, no.

Knowing that you’ve helped someone in a positive way is one of the best feeling their is.
Absolutely. Spreading positivity around like that is a wonderful feeling. 
I stopped watching movies, period. I'm too depressed
Ok? So fix that instead of telling us about it 
"I'm more interested in your brother" (I'm a girl)

Let's just keep being children then :D
If only that was a possibility lol 
I'd say it is. It's mostly a state of mind.
True, my dad is still in his early 20s in his mind and he is reacting his 60s lol
Same with mine \:D
Haha guess a lot of people in older age is like that 
It's a good thing I think. Gotta stay young!
Can’t grow to old in once mind :) 
True, my dad is still in his early 20s in his mind and he is reacting his 60s lol
Your dad sounds like he knows how to party. 
Where do you live that you get to drink at 18?
France! Where do *you* live and what's the legal drinking age there?
Here in the US it's 21 in most states, in a few others I think it might be 18
Oh really? TIL. In Europe I think it's 18 pretty much everywhere.

I think an occupational therapist can help. Good luck!

"Good job! 

I’m really proud of you :)"
How can you be proud of someone you've never met?
They can't. It's just something people say online to be nice to each other. They're empty words.
Empty words or not, I don't care. Thank you!

True words. Many people don't see the full picture behind nursing.
Yep, my sister is a nurse, so I get a pretty good picture and discussion about it
The shitposts and real posts are good on /r/nursing if you haven't subbed yet :)
Subbed for a while already, as you said, some are truly realistic, and some are complete shit. 
Some posts about literal shit as well
You’re not a competent nurse yet, but congrats!
Not even close, but with experience, the level of competence rises from day to day ;).
What area do you want to work in? 
Hospice care! Or palliative nursing in general, but I prefer hospice over anything!

As a German, you just blew my mind.

what do you call it in german? v?
Yeah close its more like "ve"

Probably has to do with V and U being the same letter in the original Latin alphabet.
That's nvts!

Well, my current hobby right now is 3D modelling and going to the gym. 😃
So you're 3d modelling your body as well?

You can, just keep doing it. That's the secret :)
Yeah, I agree with you. It's all about constant practice. 
Experts are the ones that found the most ways it doesn't work and kept trying anyway
Oh, I must have read it wrong. 😅

Cut out sugar, gained five pounds. Nothing else changed..
Maybe you've got diabeetus? Sugar makes them lose weight.

I had a job during college - had to have that beer money, hahaha."
Definitely. At my college there ain't much to do but drink or study.
Wait till you start working 14 hour shifts.
Highly unlikely that anyone would work 14 hour shifts
Many, many people work 80+ hours a week, it is fairly common in the legal profession.
Highly unlikely that anyone would work 14 hour shifts

Haha thanks, bloke! 
I couldn’t be that mean! If I knew how to screenshot i’d show you the red up arrow as proof lol
Maybe you'll get 1000 karma today
Maybe... Everyone has been upvoting and it's over 700 now!
Haha now you’ve got over 5000!
Fake internet points never felt so good haha 
That's for sure lol
You now have over 7k
I know, it's pretty intense lol
How does it feel to be living up there?! Almost at the 10k club
One time I got 3K karma for one comment
That's awesome!
That comment alone makes up more than half of my karma...
Then it was a good comment lol
Idk how but I have almost 8k and I’ve barely been here for half a year
That's really awesome. You must be good at commenting at the right time lol
I can't believe how amazing everyone is! I have about 2300 karma now. I feel so loved 😊
Guess you owe us a "I have over 2500 Karma!" post now
Dude that’s really cool, happy for you!
Thanks!
I don't understand why people give a 💩 about karma points?   It's just as ghey as FB likes.   
I also like Facebook likes
I have 8K the last time i checked
Awesome. I think I gave you an upvote the other day on something. I remember your username lol
I’m gonna look to see what subs we have in common 
I got a lucky post to the top page so I have a lot of karma that I probably don't deserve

Wow, seems you did too! Lucky!
You're jumping over all the milestones now :D
I know, I'm so excited lol
The power of internet points compels you!
I've upvoted all your comments on this and all your posts, you're welcome ;).
Thank you so much!
Don't look at my account, I'm ashamed at how long I've been here and how much karma I have
I disobeyed and looked. I think over 6k a year is a good amount of karma
Then I suppose I'm not doing too bad.
Don't let karma control your time on this site. It ruins the fun
Oh, it doesn't control me. Part of the fun for me is seeing which comments made an impact
Here's one more OP
Thanks!
You got 6k karma now. Congrats!
Thanks! I'm still so surprised that this is happening
You get an initial karma 'high' but then you get withdrawal. You gotta have more karma
I have 0 and don't know why, help :|
There, now you have 1 :)
Great.. recently I got too.. I was so happy I shared it with my ex..
Is that a good thing?
I still can't get enough karma to post on r/hiphopheads Lol 
I hope you do soon!
The first thousand is the hardest, the rest cold pretty easily

This is why I won’t have kids. They’re like abusive partners you can’t break up with.
Or it could be because nobody will sleep with you. 
So, she’s the adult? Shame on you.
Shame on you for putting people down when you know they already struggle with negativity. 
Don’t pass your bullshit in to your daughter. I stand behind my statement. Get some help!

The story of my life is basically doing stuff for others and not for myself lol
What would you like to do for yourself that you haven’t done yet?:)
I'd like to travel abroad and have a place of my own
Would you like to live abroad as well?:)
Maybe , My country is a hell hole but i still like it and I would miss it

Oh gosh, I'm sorry. That's way too close.

I think about how i let my youth, my prime, get past without enjoying freedom and life
I'm sorry you feel that way. Why is that?
Good hair day. 
When it just falls perfectly into place.
I take it you don’t live in USA?
I don't, what made you say that though? 
I hope to finish one of my acdemic projects, it's just a simple database related website.
Nice! What are you studying? 
Finally applying for jobs after graduating. Hoping to land something soon! 
Exciting for sure! What kind of work are you looking for? 
I’m gonna be honest, I’m already looking forward to breakfast tomorrow.

What do you think is their most underrated song?
For me, it'd have to be either "Don't Let Me Down" or "Oh! Darling."
“Oh! Darling” is absolutely wonderful 
I also like "Sun King." But honestly, I like everything the Beatles did. 
“Sun King” is so meditative. I love it!
That song sounds a lot like something the Doors would've recorded. 
I’m curious to know people’s favorite Beatles in order?
"1) They're

2) All

3) Great

4) Ringo"

It was a long time ago for sure.
It's called "I Origins". This movie changed my life a little bit.

I've never visited, actually, but I'd really love to.  I'd love to go with my parents someday.
Is Natty short for Natalya?
Nope.  Kind of close, but not really.

Was there any good thing happening today?
Not at all. Watched some Bojack Horseman which didn’t help with anything, obviously. 
Dannnng is it cuz this seasons sposed to be really depressing? Ive heard that. Damn.
Have you ever gone kayaking?
Unfortunately no. I’m a scaredy-cat when it comes to matters related to water sports 😿
How about walking in water that comes up to your waist?
Gotta find myself a pool first!
There are shallow, slow rivers that can be kayaked on. 
Nightmare. 
Unfortunately, my word is Fired. Yes, I got fired from my job. 
Oh, sorry to hear that. Do you have any backups?
My boyfriend was so stuck on asking me what a pinion nut was that the joke lost its oomph! Lol
"Whoops! Hopefully he doesn't think you're...


...nutty.

I will see myself out."
"You're doing that too much, please wait at least X minutes before trying again"
My mortal enemy. 
"Wanna trade, upvote for an upvote? Haha

there’s an 100% chance I won’t reply
I'm really socially awkward in the first place
Guysss😭😂
TRUE
No. I will never alter my body. 
Why ? I've never had a conversation with someone sharing this opinion.
Because despite being an ugly mug I'll never hurt my precious body. No holes or tattoos. 
I see, would you get bothered if one of your relatives got one for example?
It looks good on some guys but personally I wouldn't do it .
Why wouldn't you ? 
Nah I tried on the magnetic ones ,didn't like the look ...looked like a try hard.
You're brave. Thanks for doing that. You're a good guy
I’d hope he’d stand up for a guy too tho
Yeah but why even be negative? Men have to go through this wayyyy less than women.
I’d hope he’d stand up for a guy too tho
"Why....say this?

Feels like it came out of nowhere. "
Well...it’s true. People much more likely to stick up for a female 
I’d hope he’d stand up for a guy too tho
What a hero you would be if any of this had actually happened.  Get out more 
"And then everybody stood up and clapped."
When you said girl "I got pedo vibes". OP, can you clarify this for us?

Seeing three upvotes made me feel better lol sad but true thank you Reddit 
Call it a night and go to sleep. You'll be better in the morning. Works for me usually.
Seeing three upvotes made me feel better lol sad but true thank you Reddit 
If three upvotes made your day, I wonder what 1,300 will do.
Cheers bud, Here's to hoping tomorrow won't be as awful as today. 
Odd coincidence ur user name is also my listless sisters name. 
Maybe you should teach her how to make a list someday. Then she won't be listless!!
no, she’s constantly listing and needs to list less
I enjoy tumblr from a distance at /r/tumblr
As somebody who loves funny Tumblr posts but got none of that on Tumblr itself, thanks for this!

Nahhhhhhh"
I really like electric swing music. All my friends haaate it. It’s just so fun and catchy. 
I think you'd like French House. Check out Daft Punk's older stuff

"My favourite musical genre is sea shanties.

Should be being productive. Now I'm listening to sea shanties.
I listen to witch house and electro and such... I never get to play music in my group of friends
Witch house is to electronic music as death metal is to rock lol.

Maybe that's a sign that driving isn't for you and OP? How did it go wrong so often?
Get better friends?
But I don't have any friends... why do you think I'm on reddit.

So That’s what karma is for, aside from the butt pats, I always wondered 
I do also love a good butt-pat, however 
"Wait, subs have karma limits?

That's why religion can be such a good thing for some people, it gives you a sense of purpose.

Hi friend!
My phone's battery lasts 2 days.

Then this is the wrong post to say that.
If it was possible to overdose on tea, I'd have died  at age 13.

What else is Reddit for but to distract us from day to day droning of the workplace... 
Love it !!!
How the fuck did you manage to get that type of relationship on reddit in a matter of weeks 
Honesty, would be my guess.
Even then. That'd take a HUGE vetting process. It sounds very impulsive to me.

A Little old lady

Took a short scroll through post history, you seem annoying.
Funny though, right? Like you mean annoying in a Will Ferrell type way?
You're an attention whore who is trying too hard to garner said attention. Lighten up.
I disagree. You didn’t fin any post or comment you read funny?
Thanks for reinforcing my point.
I’m light! Look! I lightened up. But which ones were funny?
Thanks for reinforcing my point.

""Without drinking or eating nothing"

So, you ate something?"
Nothing, laying on the bed as usual.
Doesn't sound half bad :P I'm doing the same thing
What are you doing when are you laying in bed? 
Typically playing xbox, watching Netflix, or listening to music/audiobook. What about you?
Mostly listening music and redditing/snapchatting.
sounds like a blast. I'll be doing that, with a side of xbox.
I'm known as that "weird dude" that doesn't talk much and has no friends.
Weird is awesome. Do you prefer being alone?

I appreciate it :) although there isn't much choosing, it sort of just happens
Haha yeah. Ahh to be 17 again. You've got the best years of your life ahead of you:)

Why are you transitioning?
Efficiency reasons. Also cereal just tastes better with a big spoon

If it’s at 665, I have to.
I was so close to liking a post, then saw it as at 666
I upvoted this from 29 to 30 just for you.
thank you for your service 🙏
I downvoted from 641 to 640. I'm sorry.
I upvoted this from 29 to 30 just for you.
I upvoted 9 to 10 just for you.
I do the opposite. I like to upvote to make it odd-numbered...

I'm like the Joker to your Batman, or something!
"ok WHOM keeps downvoting so that it goes back to the 69?? 

u trynna torture me or sum???"
I upped it so you can be at 2069
"ok WHOM keeps downvoting so that it goes back to the 69?? 

u trynna torture me or sum???"
Upvoted to a nice round 20
Will always and forever upvote 68. Always.
Although I am a bit conflicted, I gotta: 69 --&gt; 70
At which point i down vote. Hazard of the job.
I do it every time I see something or someone with a 666 karma. I’m superstitious, I guess.
doing the Lord's work
saw this post had 99 comments.
I got the 10!!
Only if it's at 618
aaaa I don't know this reference. *googles it furiously*
Did you figure it out yet? 
"All. The. Time.

I have also felt trapped when I couldn't upvote something because it was at 69."
I just have to do it, can't resist. Even if it means betraying the meme. 
Now I want to follow all of OPs comments and make them uneven 
u mean odd?

What gender would you be in that scenario?
Talk to my ex so she will be able to love me again.
What do you mean by this?
Try to get a blowjob from my wife and then penetrate her with my now real dick
But would she let you considering shes lesbian would she?......
"Lift up my shirt in disbelief.

Probably be very happy."

Oh, honey. Like I need more reasons to want to kill myself.
Google the nearest lesbian bar. 
So your sexual orientation wouldn’t change even if you changed gender?
"I’ll answer your question with a question - how big are my boobs?

Are you male in that scenario, or are you actually a male?

Some of the most well known songs are based around 2 or 3 chords just saying.
Everybody keeps mentioning that. Is keeping chords simple the art to playing guitar well?
I'm only human. 
That’s exactly what a robot would say 
Oh no, my secret is out. 
Gotcha! 
We're still on track to take over the world soon though... 
Bold of you to assume humans won’t destroy it first
That's just a thing some people do. It happens to me pretty frequently.
Would you say consistently, like always phasing out of one into another?
I'll go a few weeks without any big interest sometimes.
All the time. Some interests stick around but I fall out of love with new things as well.
Nice! Glad there are more of us out there
I just gotta learn to narrow it down and follow through more often.
Glad to hear a nice black friday story for a change!

The guy at the game stop by me would've just spit on me and called me pathetic. This is rad. 
Not me. I love the sunshine. Golden warm, just enough to make your skin glow.
I like the sun in theory, but my pale skin disagrees.

When you jump onto reddit what are you really hoping to find?
To be very honest, quality memes is what im after.
That is the very top of your list for why you come?
Ask me one question
Only one... alright you win. What parts of you make you not "ordinary"?
Ask me anything!
What idea do you wish was main stream? 
ask me what is my favorite colour  :D
What if I don't? 
Then you will never know  :P
And what do you think that deprivation would mean to me?
Ask me a question.
Would you rather be right or prove someone else wrong?
Aren’t they one in the same?
Throw something at me

Secondary question, why isn’t it called a Masterate, as in Doctorate 
In some languages it is i.e in Portuguese they are called Mestrado and Doutorado respectively. 
I think that's the case in all Romance/Latin languages.
Not in French. Master / Doctorat.

Secondary question, why isn’t it called a Masterate, as in Doctorate 
Too close to a bad typo
I could see black people having an issue with calling someone “Master”.
Yeah there's no way I'm calling anyone especially a white person "master".
Master is the title of young unwed boys already
So master means bachelor. Would be funny if bachelor meant doctor.
People with PhD’s aren’t real doctors 
My PhD diploma says otherwise..
"It’s called a degree.

When you graduate high school you get a diploma.

Thank you."
I have my masters and I absolutely wish this were true 
As you wish master QueenLorax. 
It is the norm to come in with shoes.

Do you have to play for Plex? It seems interesting.  Also doesn't Hulu have ads now?
Mine was $70 for lifetime
That really isn't bad at all.  I might have to look into it
I've dumped 25x that into hardware though
hulu has ads. p sure this fake bruv

I’m glad to hear that Nate! 
Good luck! Hope you’re a match. Do you happen to know the blood type?
Wow you're such an amazing person! :)
Nah, my little brother is though! 
Were they able to use your kidney?

It’s a Catholic tradition, I don’t know of any other denomination that practices it. 
dang, I was raised catholic and wouldn't even think twice about serving you beef haha
I thought about that too! I wouldn't try to correct someone's order, but Im glad she did.
I thought it was just supposed to be on Fridays during lent...
dang, I was raised catholic and wouldn't even think twice about serving you beef haha
I had an older couple come in yesterday after service and order beer and steaks lmao
What?? Ashes? We're you carrying an urn? Can you not eat meat after a funeral? 
It’s for Ash Wednesday. It’s a Catholic holiday 
Cheese in wantons? 
Cream cheese!
Miércoles de ceniza?
Yep. For many the end of carnival, lmao.
Wouldn’t want to eat beef and go to hell
Literally 
No, lol
Ashes...?

That's awesome!!
Thank you. It’s really a relief.
Congratulations! It's always good to hear someone turn their grades around. 
I turned my grades around this semester too. I was doing so well but now I'm doing terrible. 
Well that's not what you want lmao. What happened? Just a tough semester?
Wow that’s awesome! Spanish was difficult for me as well.
Yeah it’s super difficult. In middle school it was light work but high school Spanish isn’t fun.
You can also eat toast raw if you need to.

In all fairness, The IT Crowd also has an annoying laugh track. 
But wasn't it filmed in front of a live audience? I think that's a little different 
Well, so were Friends and TBBT, doesn't stop it feeling out of place. 
It doesn't seem that out of place for Friends. The laugh track has a antiquated 90's feel to it
It seems out of place for a show that is not in the least bit funny. See: Big Bang Theory
I used to find friends hilarious, but I don't think it's aged very well.

Now to make sure to save $ and be frugal!!!for rainy days 
Yessss!! I wanna see 7 figures in that savings account lol

Is your husband single?
Ehh give it 6 months you'll have your chance then
Oh man you owe him a 3 some lol

Can I be your baby sister? 😂
Lololol our babysitter can never know how much money we make
Don’t get your hope up to high. He’s probably about to divorce you and marry a supermodel. 
Have you never had a stable relationship before?
I bet he thinks he earned it all lol
Maybe that's because he did!
If you have 0 spending money don't have a kid lmao
The $0 spending money came *because* of the kid, not before we had him.

If you ever bonded with your parents, you would know.

Giving upvotes to strangers."
Most people on Reddit are strangers to me, so I get that feeling a lot.
Isnt that a great feeling till someone ruins it ey
How so?
Well either A) someone upvotes making inmt 1001 or B someone donevotes its making it 998
Then it's on to the quest for the next round number.
I'd say the quest to get laid is more fruitful
or 419 to 420
LOL
or 419 to 420
665 to 666
Keep an eye on me. 5,996
Got you! That was awesome!
:o thank you!
Huzzah! A man of quality
Hmmm - woman. :)
My apologies
Had the opportunity of doing it once, it was really satisfying.
I hope you get to do it again soon!
But not the other side of that, I get anxiety when I have to ruin a perfect number of likes 😩
Oh my goodness - why did you have to put that in my head??? LOL
I'll take some karma...
Here you go! 😊
Want some gold? Take two 🏅🏅
I just got to do that for the first time!
Yay! Welcome to the club!
I am at 997 right now. Help a redditor out to reach 1K?
I did what I could! 💖
Thank you for your help :)))
I upvoted a YouTube video from 9.9K to 10K. It was probably the greatest moment of my life
You can upvote in YouTube
We really need to stop using "abused" as an umbrella term
How was this not abuse?
Abuse has a sexual connotation these days, it's an uncleae term
Wait why did the first lawyer yell at your son? I’m confused
Judging by your comment history you're 12.
"I would punch my way through that aid's skull.
She's lucky you're the father..."
r/Iamverybadass
ok.
Sounds like your son doesn't belong in public education to me.
Public education should be for everyone. This is the school’s failing, not the parent’s.
Was this in the news? I think I remember hearing about it.
It was not. We talked about sending it to the press, but decided not to.
Hot dogs.
Sounds good!
Just had peanut butter and strawberry jelly.
No bread?
Yes, of course

A jam sandwich.  Take two pieces of bread and jam em together.
Salmon and veggies.
Ooooh good stuff! Prepared any certain way?
Some freezer naan with homemade meatballs
I love homemade meatballs. I'm unfamiliar with naan though.
It’s Indian flatbread! Even the freeEr variety is lovely. Fluffy, but crunchy when grilled.
This is just sad

I know, the person above you is what is actuallly sad. I worry they will never get it.

Anonymity gives people courage.
I don’t know if courage is the right word...
Being on reddit, you are automatically somehow better than everyone else.
Sweet! I'm usually worse than everyone else
Go fuck yourself.
Noooo shoo, shoo! You're polluting the clean air here.
I rather be rude on reddit than real life ..
Be polite in both?
Rude = Upvotes
You're literally the only one who answered with that explanation. Kudos

issa ghost?
Oh, spooky.
Yeah deffo, I’m more or less alone for the time being
I've been too much of an asshole, guess I gotta change how I act, get my shit together.
This is actually eating me alive. I literally have no one to talk to and it’s driving me insane.
Wanna talk about it?
I do. Guess I just don’t know how.
Lol I used to until I fell asleep in the stall at work one day
can you learn this power?

Hey! How’s it going?
Good! How are you?
Doing pretty well! What’s your favorite tv show?
I don't really watch a lot of tv, so it's hard to answer.
What do you like to do in your spare time in that case?
I spend a lot of my time listening to music and checking sports stuff.
Sounds fun, what are some of your music recommendations?
Hey what’s up?
Not too much, just watching some Netflix, hbu?
Same! Watching a comedy special. What are you watching?

You actually get matches on dating apps???
Maybe once every 3-4 months. Half of them unmatched right away
But half didn't...
If half didn’t what? Then I’d have twice as many people that ignore me?
You said half unmatched you. That means half didn't.
Define “regular.” Do you mean I go there every day or what?
You are.
Watch how toddlers move for a natural example of proper deadlift and squat form.
You are not wrong. And I have never realized it.
Palm trees are more closely related to grass than actual trees

If you're a fan of water based fruits I'd recommend freezing them about halfway for new flavors
Like a strawberry or something?
I think so, watermelon is my favorite example however
I will try that. Have you seen people cook watermelon 'steaks'?
I just looked it up, that's definitely a no lol
I've heard they are very nice.
Are you Charlie Kelly?
If you are serious, no. If it is a joke, yes.
Is it watermelon season yet? I can't wait to buy and eat it whole.
Even if it is they definitely don't grow it where I am.
Well, they don't grow it in Siberia either but we usually have shitloads of them, literally

Room temp here is 90 F (30 C) lol
You heat your home to 30 at winter?

Wilson or Calvin?
So essentially, volleyball or underwear? I gotta go with the volleyball
How about Christopher or Victor?
Victor sounds kinda nice. Bold compared to my current name, but I might be able to pull it off

Awesome! But what made you end a 8 year relationship? Was it that bad?
Wasn't bad. Just wasn't... Good? Well it was good but I think we just sort of grew apart.
Why ending the relationship ? Has he done anything wrong ? or you didn't love him anymore ?
Nothing wrong. Just sort of... Drifted apart I guess.
Hmm, usually midlife crisis happen later in life.
All depends on how long you intend to live! ;)

According to his movies, he might deserve them...but he's not allowed to keep them.
:(
It’s just starting to feel like people are worshiping him
He's worthy, it's fine
We're not worthy! We're not worthy!
It’s just starting to feel like people are worshiping him
I’m out of the loop. Why is he being mentioned so much lately?
Because John Wick 3 came out and people are reminded he's s pretty great guy.
I thought he was called Neil in the matrix when I first saw it.
I’m so glad I’m not alone in this. I legit thought his name was Neal for YEARS.
I would give up my best friends life so keanu can live another day
You’re a shit friend if you’re serious

I do the same thing but thumbs down. I'm not mad, I'm disappointed.

I thought that was “fancy a toke?”
I blew a kiss once which confused the super aggressive bloke who was tailgating me.
"Be careful doing shit like that. You're goading an aggressive person. 
Is goading a word?"
"Be careful doing shit like that. You're goading an aggressive person.

"Pow! Right in the kisser!!!

I’m not sure what to say...congratulations or that sucks or what
Yeah, I have no idea how to feel. My nerves are just shot at this point

That seems appropriate for some reason at this point
For the low low price of $1500 a month, I will keep the ghosts away

Sounds rough. I hate if when I mess my back up
Any tips on speeding up healing?
A hot shower usually does it for me
Sounds like a great idea!
And barring that, a hot bath with some Epsom salts
Ahh, yes. A nice long salty soak!
Like a steak
That's a good man right there
 Hell yeah, I've never once been let down by him.
That's a good man right there
is that a destiny flair?
Good eye you have,  it definitely is.

What’s kg in freedom units aka pounds?
40 kg is aprox. 6,2 bald eagles
The NHS BMI calculator says that's a healthy weight. Good on you.
Im still a bit on the heavy side i think, but im still working on it! Thanks for the support!
I did too. Though it dropped me to 28kg.
You gotta explain, did you loose 40 or 28 kg?
I dropped to weighing 28kg
Oh my, how is that possible? I hope you are okay, 28 kg is not healthy at all...
Thanks though :)
Hope you will be okay! Good luck :)
What service are you using to host it?
This is all on SoundCloud.
I didn't even know there was a like feature on soundcloud lol
If you managed to lose 20 kg, i am guessing you were overweight to beging with.

I would openly sell them if I could. but it’s copyright infringement so I don’t.
I too can convince a child that *scribble E L S A scribble* is Elsa's real signature!
Why are you being unkind?
I’m making a joke about children, not being unkind. Why do you jump to “unkind” so quickly?
Oh, well it didn't seem like a joke.  It came off as you raining on the parade in general imho.
Do you have one for Gastion?
Yeah I do

Try being a driver in Denmark LOL. Then you’ll really hate recreational cyclists.
Lol, plot twist, princesskeester has nervous breakdown, moves to Denmark, becomes a cyclist.
Haven't accepted it no, I hate it. I don't do anything as a result. It's depressing.

You like walking alone? Better try traveling alone. You learn so much of life.
Just got back friday from a solo road trip. Just me, the bike, and the road. Lovely.
Me too. I go hiking alone once or twice a month and it is always great.

My marriage is just about to start 5th grade.   We’ve got a ways to go.

Green is the best colour. Anyone saying yellow though, is *out of their mind*

If you can’t find happiness alone my dude you won’t find it within someone else.
Either that's a lie or having a relationship is pointless
They kinda are, unless you want to make a brat.
Then why do people who don't want kids get into relationships?
Because they live in a world that shames you for being single?
Either that's a lie or having a relationship is pointless
Its not a lie, be your own best friend and the rest will fall into place.

Not to replace him, but could you adopt another dog? It might replicate similar feelings

I play thunderstorm sounds on my phone the entire time I’m asleep, every night.
I would sleep with you anytime.
THAT WHENT FROM 0 TO 100 REAL QUICK
0 to 30 at most.
THAT WHENT FROM 0 TO 100 REAL QUICK
I’m simply saying that I would sleep with them. I sleep well with those sounds.
I know, it just sounds like something... else
That’s the funny part.
I would sleep with you anytime.
I created a chat
Yeah I saw that. I’m writing. Can’t write and chat. Throws my train of thought out the window.

That sounds wonderful. Where do you stay, i wanna move there
Why do you type out every word except "rly"?

Your grammar gives me a headache.
Glad thats what u got out of this lol
Possibly unpopular statement but introverts don't necessarily need "fixing"
No one said they do
"You go mah duuude.

Party on and be excellent. I love this. Makes me feel all warm and 90’s.
Party on and be excellent. I love this. Makes me feel all warm and 90’s.
Tbh when I feel like I'm in the 90's it's usually not a positive feeling but I agree with you
Oh man the 90s were kind of the good old days when you still had to keep your mouth shut
I think he's making a joke, as in he feels 90 years old?
Oh no I meant 1990-1999
"......

Yes I'm aware of what you were doing. I'm telling you he was making a joke."
Oh so sorry! Yeah ok I see it now
Party on and be excellent. I love this. Makes me feel all warm and 90’s.

That's not good. You're supposed to only like Girls.
That's not good. You're supposed to support the LGBTQ.
"I have eidetic(photographic) memory 

I'm an only child

I'm an orphan"
Because the two others are oddly specific, #2 seems like the fake one
I wish i had 1, but that's false
Now you have to tell me about your memory. How do you use it ?
I think you misread my comment

i have french citizenship

i have been to France"
You haven’t been to France right ?

Oh, you’re an expat ?

I have never and will never use an Uber.
Why not?
I find that cabbies tend to be minorities from out of the country, I like that.
Took ~20 uber in my life, and all of them except 1 ! were from north Africa.
Interesting. Do you live in a coastal city?
I find that cabbies tend to be minorities from out of the country, I like that.
That has changed. A lot of uber drivers are minorities now.
Maybe. But Texas isn’t very diverse.

What kind of homework is it?
Calculus, end my suffering.
Oh, jeez. Lol. Hope it wasn't too hard. I suck HARD at math and whatever has numbers in it.
Me too, dude. It gets even worse when they throw in letters.
Have you ever wondered what those things at the end of a shoelace are called?
They’re called aglets, Phineas and Ferb taught me that one.
I started watching the second season of Stranger Things, and now am peeing

Laying in bed trying to go to sleep but I can’t get this girl off my mind

I only recently started liking French toast too, within the past two years or so.
Very important advice

Have you looked in the back of your throat with a light? You might have tonsil stones.
Honestly good advice, but I'm here for a good time not a long time
Won't be that good of a time with a preventable illness.
I wont live long enough to get any illnesses tbh.

"Oh the folly of youth.

There is a huge gradient between alive and dead."
I really can’t afford to see a doctor
Sorry to be blunt but funerals ain't cheap either.
Its cheaper than what it cost for me to take a 5 mile trip in an ambulance to the hospital

Perhaps. Although I’m in Australia
TIL that surprisingly most Australians *don't* fly pirate flags
It's probably meant tongue-in-cheek. He may have recently become a fan of pirates.
Which would be an unlikely but kind of cool thing for him. I really hope it’s this!
Oh my gosh! I never knew this. Although it makes so much more sense now.
Glad it wasnt just me!
... Whelp. TIL.
Yeah, English is a funny and weird language at times as a Seond-English speaker
Yup, like that word "whelp". It means "puppy".
"I didn't know until this very second.
I always interpreted it as enthusiasm. 😂"
That's what I thought! I thought it was more like "see you!" "Back at ya!"
I think it’s evolved to mean that instead! But now it seems very backhanded haha.
"I didn't know until this very second.
I always interpreted it as enthusiasm. 😂"
Not sure I’m being whooshed but the word is euphemism FYI.

Wait, what? Also, how old was he?"
He's in his mid 30's. He can tell his fans now that he was promoted from employee to customer.
What "Fans" dose a (former) forklift driver (who still lives with his parents?) have?
Idk "peeps" I guess. Maybe a podcast too. "Live from my mom's basement"
What "Fans" dose a (former) forklift driver (who still lives with his parents?) have?
"His fans?

Also, who brings mommy in to work to help fix a problem?  Guy sounds like a loser."

"how did you write this when you're blind?
Just curious"
I use screen reading software built into my phone.
I think a lot of people just really want to be heroes
Maybe but they still should ask and if we say no, listen to us.
Oh yes definitely. Peoples egos just go to their heads often, I suppose.
How are you typing and reading?

Sorry for the late reply, I just read your response."

Wait, how did you write this

NOICE.
When I woke up this morning I couldn't see.
I rubbed my eyes and stumbled out of bed, hitting a table and hurting my knee.
After hopping around on one foot I felt something wet, it was pee.
I shouted "Ooh wee!" And tried to hurry to the bathroom... But my injury had betrayed me.
You wouldn’t believe what happened last night
Aliens visited my house!
I know it sounds crazy, but I have proof- let me show you
They left their burrito wrappers all over my lawn.
And then a fluffy cat licked the burritos.
The cat reacted to the alien burritos in a strange way.
It became an alien itself!
And that's how my cat got deported.
That was my evidence for you, but now I have this for you instead
It's a cupcake, you deserve it.
*person #2:* thanks! But what does this have to do with aliens?
Eat it and find out. *bwahahaha*
The cat reacted to the alien burritos in a strange way.

That's cool because humans don't have souls either.
Me and Mister Mittens are going to Hell together.
Cats obviously have deeply corrupted souls.
Not my boy Tom, he's a pure innocent snuggle bean who wants hugs and kisses 24/7
Any Scandinavian language, because I love their lore and how they sound
I have friends that are fluent in swedish!
That’s great! Good luck, hope you enjoy it!
Thank you!
Think of it like a hot tub, you sit, pee and soak. What more could you ask for?
...pee?
I mean, how else are you going to keep it warm? 😅
...pee?
You can also wash children and dogs in them.  Cats not recommended.
Sounds like something a cat would say...
Aww. Sorry, OP
It’s whatever. I don’t need to be with an asshole

"This book made me thinks of the book 
 "Boy's Life" by Robert R. McCammon"
Book?
That's lovely. Simple things!
The simplest things make the biggest differences 😉
I do this sometimes too, and it's really effective. But it's hard to do it sincerely sometimes.
When you really love someone though, they’re the easiest to be genuine with :)
You should consider teaching, coaching, or mentoring. We can always use great people like you.
Oh man, social anxiety would make me a horrible mentor unfortunately ):

To be fair, that not really constructive or adding to the conversation.
Heartbreaking? LMFAO dude get over yourself.
"I can't! Get over myself, that is. 

And you can't either. Ego is a peculiar thing."
Who cares about upvotes though?

Why though?
And you care about downvotes why?
They're a form of negative reinforcement. Duh

Congratulating him is good, but dont let it go to his head, that was how I failed.

You sweety can DM me here anytime you feel lonely
Alright! Is there anything in particular you like? Everyone has likes.
You can find people here that will be very pleased to have a conversation with you.
Are you one of them?
If you want to talk, I’m open.
Should we talk through comments or PM? I'd love to talk.
Gave it a listen, giving me serious early 2000s Arctic Monkeys vibes. Love it x
Yeah even the logo
What genre is it? I might give it a listen
Think arctic monkeys and you’re there
I can't remember if I like them or not...
Teddy picker etc
I'll just listen to them
Where in England are you based?
I think they said Sheffield in an earlier comment
Yes, and that their variety is beautiful.
Their differing kinds really amaze me, especially the colourful ones
Everything that is alive came from dinosaurs. Not just birds.
Not entirely true. Crocodilians evolved before the dinosaurs and still exist to this day
Crocodiles are Archosaurs, as are birds and dinosaurs. Regardless, that isn't my point.
MAKE her take up painting again
No! She's an adult and can do what she likes. You could ask her to teach you, though.
"Burger King have the best deal!

This is why I love birds, they are so cute! But they can be really mean to so :/
They are quite unpredictable, right?
Does it like mangos? Random question.
I tried to feed him mango once and he loved it!
unfortunately green is not a creative colour
What’s your favorite idea? Mine is thinking creatively.
How do you get that idea?
Because it's liquid CHOCOLATE

Another Childs life ruined by a Gay couple. Sickening.
How do you figure that monumental amount of bullshit?
Your level of ignorance indicates that you are probably American. Nuff said
Ah, casually announcing to Reddit that you're going to ruin another childs life.  So adorable.
When you say ruin her life you mean give her a loving supportive stable home.
Allowing your adoption is child abuse.  Full stop.
Smoke all the pot you can now!!!! Before you have to hide it!
Hahaha
A good parent can be a stoner! But a pot head cannot!

There's nothing wrong with it as long as you have friends
but there is something wrong if i don't?
Well not having friends isn't good for your health probably
You're the only one being awkward about it. It's fine.
Hm, yeah maybe it is fine after all, I just wouldn't want my friends to be bored
That doesn't have anything to do with gender. Don't be a boring host and plan things to do!
I'm 21f and I have no friends, the only online friends I have are male. Can I meet your friends?
Guess you can also come to my birthday party :D Where are you from?

It sends a subtle reminder for people to behave.

Happens to most of us. Nowadays, I'm trying to be expressive and just post it anyways.
Are you not afraid that I won’t care what you say!
I always think my comments sound stupid, so yes.
I get that, I appreciate you commenting here. It can be so nerve racking to post anything.
I frequently write comments and then self-censor for privacy and for being afraid of rejection.
I feel that. The fear of rejection is strong. I’m glad you posted this. ☺️
Is this fear healthy or does it qualify as something that should be treated?
At least daily. Almost did it with this comment, in fact.
I’m glad you didn’t delete this! 💛
Bro I just feel like someone's probably already said it so there's no point in me saying it too
Ya never know, maybe you’ll say it differently that resonates with someone. Happy cake day!! 💛
Just did it
Woohoo!! I’m glad you did. ☺️
I found a first gen Ipad in my couch.
Score!
I found my old iPod touch but I had a password on it I can’t remember so it sucks
Damn, that sucks. Is there a way to reset the password through your AppleID account?
I’ll have to look at that. I’m not sure if it’s the same Apple id as now
I thought at first you found it in your conch
That would be one magic conch
What music can't you find online anymore? I bet you, you can.
Nah. A lot of it is demos of friends’ bands and songs I recorded.
That's not something you'd ever have found on the internet then lol. Not fair.
Can you upload the songs? All of them! I kinda wanna listen to them
Once I get them on to my pc possibly.

did it just sink there one day?"

Significantly. I'd be shut-in but for this.
Its nice to have some kind of interactions.
Sure is. All kinds in these parts..
I had someone told me to go F myself. That hurt.
It's just a way to grow a thicker skin and more discernment. Go f yourself is mild stuff..
Ahh.. I see.. gotta start growing thicker skins. Lol.

It's a pretty color, once you use it well.
Green, red and blue. All deep shades and muted tones

Green, red and blue. All deep shades and muted tones
I love a nature Green and bright white as a color combo.
Black black and black
I especially love how the black matches with the black creating a dark black aura.
There's nothing like a dark black aura. Black already is the darkest thing there is.

Borderlands psycho, nice! What character did you pick for BL3?
I picked Zane originally, then Amara for my second play through. I'm loving Amara
Nice! I love Amara. I went with her first and I'm thinking of starting a Zane next myself.
I loved Zane too, he has some amazing grenade abilities

No no no,  I'm pretty sure it's still 2012.

But remember how the 20s ended?
The Great Depression &amp; the rise of history's most vile dictators
Yeah its crazy, im gonna miss the 2010s

A little controversial. I love it but particularly with angel hair and just doused in hot sauce
Like regular hot sauce or tomato based hot sauce
Opinion on spaghetti
Personally I think it's overrated
FALSE
I only like the meatballs. What's so special about the sauce?
Sauce is very important to spaghetti
I know but I don't even like the sauce. It's just tomato what's so special about it?
There’s more than just tomato sauce. Also really complements the starchiness of the noodles.
I just naturally don't like the taste of normal tomato sauce honestly.
